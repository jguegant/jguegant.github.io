I wanted, since few years, to write my thoughts somewhere in order to clarify them and be able to easily fetch them later on. I procrastinated the idea of running a tech blog for few years, my aversion for the over-engineered web technologies and a lack of motivation restrained me. However, I have more spare time these days and I stumbled upon a simple and elegant Python static blog generator called &lt;a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;strong&gt;Pelican&lt;/strong&gt; I don't have to pull a thousand of npm packages for a sanatizing function neither to use the latest language for hipsters with an eccentric syntax. Static pages also greatly simplify the maintenance and decrease the security burdens of dynamic websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this blog is mostly for my own purpose, I also hope that I could get an external opinion on my posts, my methods or even my skills in the beautiful English language.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="blog"></category></entry></feed>
