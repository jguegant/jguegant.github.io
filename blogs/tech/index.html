      <h2>Trivia:</h2>
<p>As a quest to obtain the highly coveted title of <strong>Lead Senior C++ Over-Engineer</strong>, I decided last year to rewrite the game I work on during daytime (Candy Crush Saga) using the quintessence of modern C++ (C++17). And... thus was born <a href="https://github.com/Jiwan/meta_crush_saga">Meta Crush Saga</a>: a <strong>compile-time game</strong>. I was highly inspired by <a href="https://blog.mattbierner.com/stupid-template-tricks-snake/">Matt Bernier's Nibbler game</a> that used pure template meta-programming to recreate our the famous snake game we could play on our Nokia 3310 back in the days.</p>
<p>"What the <s>hell</s> heck is a <strong>compile-time game</strong>?", "How does it looks like?", "What <strong>C++17</strong> features did you use in this project?", "What was your learnings?" might come to your mind. To answer these questions you can either read the rest of this post or accept your inner laziness and watch the video version of this post, which is a talk I made during a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/swedencpp/events/246069743/">Meetup event</a> in Stockholm:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XV1lXtB3sqg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Disclaimer: for the sake of your sanity and the fact that <em>errare humanum est</em>, this article might contain some alternative facts.</p>
<h2>A compile-time game you said?</h2>
<p><img width=20% height=20% src="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/images/what-does-this-mean.png"/></p>
<p>I believe that it's easier to understand what I mean by the "concept" of a <strong>compile-time game</strong> if you compare the life cycle of such a game with the life cycle of a normal game. So here it is!</p>
<h3>Life cycle of a normal game:</h3>
<p>As a normal game developer with a normal life working at a normal job with a normal sanity level you would usually start by writing your <strong>game logic</strong> using your favorite language (C++ of course!), then fire your <strong>compiler</strong> to transform this, far too often spaghetti-like, logic into an <strong>executable</strong>. As soon as you double-click on your <strong>executable</strong> (or use the console), a <strong>process</strong> will be spawned by your operating system. This <strong>process</strong> will execute your <strong>game logic</strong> which 99.42% of time consists of a <strong>game loop</strong>. A <strong>game loop</strong> will <strong>update</strong> the state of your game according to some rules and the <strong>user inputs</strong>, <strong>render</strong> the newly computed state of your game in some flashy pixels, again, again and again.</p>
<p><img alt="Life cycle of a normal game" src="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/images/life-cycle-normal-game.png"></p>
<h3>Life cycle of a compile-time game:</h3>
<p>As an over-engineer cooking the next big compile-time game, you will still have use of your favorite language (still C++ of course!) to write your <strong>game logic</strong>. You will still have a <strong>compilation phase</strong> but... then... here comes the plot twist: you will <strong>execute</strong> your <strong>game logic</strong> within this compilation step. One could call it a compilutation. This is where C++ truly comes in handy ; it has a some features like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming">Template Meta Programming (TMP)</a> or <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constexpr">constexpr</a> to actually have <strong>computations</strong> happening during the <strong>compilation phase</strong>. We will dive later on the features you can use to do so. As we are executing the <strong>logic</strong> of the game during this phase, we must also inject the <strong>user inputs</strong> at that point in time. Obviously, our compiler will still output an <strong>executable</strong>. What could it be used for? Well, the executable will not contain any <strong>game loop</strong> anymore, but it will have a very simple mission: output the newly <strong>computed state</strong>. Let's name this <strong>executable</strong> a <strong>renderer</strong> and its <strong>output</strong> the <strong>rendering</strong>. Our <strong>rendering</strong> won't contain any fancy particule effect nor ambiant occlusion shadows, it will be in ASCII. An ASCII <strong>rendering</strong> of your newly computed <strong>state</strong> has the nice property that you can easily show it to your player, but you also copy it into a text file. Why a text file? Obviously because you can combine it with your <strong>code</strong> in some way, redo all the previous steps and therefore have a <strong>loop</strong>.</p>
<p>As you may understand now, a <strong>compile-time</strong> game is made of a <strong>game-loop</strong> where each <strong>frame</strong> of your game is a <strong>compilation step</strong>. Each <strong>compilation step</strong> is computing a new <strong>state</strong> of your game, that you can present to your player and also inject to the following <strong>frame</strong> / <strong>compilation step</strong>. </p>
<p>I let you contemplate this magnificient diagram for as much time as it takes you to understand what I just wrote above:
<img alt="Life cycle of a compile-time game" src="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/images/life-cycle-compile-time-game.png"></p>
<p>Before we move on the implementation details of such a loop, I am sure that you have one question you would like to shoot at me...</p>
<h3>"Why would you even do that?"</h3>
<p><img width=25% height=25% src="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/images/why-would-you-even-do-that.png"/></p>
<p>Do you really think I would let you break my C++ meta-programming idyll with such a fundamental question? Never!</p>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, a <strong>compile-time game</strong> will have amazing runtime performances since most of the computations are done during the <strong>compilation phase</strong>. Runtime performance is a key to the success of your AAA game in ASCII art! </li>
<li>You lessen the probability that a wild crustacean appears in your github repository and ask you to rewrite your game in <strong>Rust</strong>. His well-prepared speech on security will fall appart as soon as you explain that a dangling pointer cannot exist at compile-time. Smug <strong>Haskell</strong> programmers might even approve the <strong>type-safety</strong> of your code.</li>
<li>You will gain respect from the <strong>Javascript</strong> hipster kingdom, where any over-complicated framework with a strong NIH syndrom can reign as long as it has a catchy name.</li>
<li>One of my friend used to say that any line of code from a Perl program provides you de-facto a very strong password. I surely bet that he never tried generating credentials from <strong>compile-time C++</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what? Aren't you satisfied with my answers? Then, maybe your question should have been: "Why could you even do that?".</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I really wanted to play with the features introduced by <strong>C++17</strong>. Quite a few of them focus on improving the expressiveness of the language as well as the meta-programming facilities (mainly constexpr). Instead of writing small code samples, I thought that it would be more fun to turn all of this into a game. Pet projects are a nice way to learn concepts that you may not use before quite some time at work. Being able to run the core logic of your game at compile-time proves once a again that templates and constepxr are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">turing complete</a> subsets of the C++ language.</p>
<h2>Meta Crush Saga: an overview</h2>
<h3>A Match-3 game:</h3>
<p><strong>Meta Crush Saga</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile-matching_video_game">tiled-matching game</a> similar to <strong>Bejeweled</strong> or <strong>Candy Crush Saga</strong>. The core of the rules consists in matching three or more tiles of the same pattern to increase your scores. Here is sneak peek of a <strong>game state</strong> I "dumped" (dumping ASCII is pretty damn easy): </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="sa">R</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="dl">(</span><span class="s"></span>

</pre></div>


<p>The game-play of this specific Match-3 is not so interesting in itself, but what about the architecture running all of this? To understand it, I will try to explain each part of the life cycle of this <strong>compile-time</strong> game in term of code.</p>
<h3>Injecting the game state:</h3>
<p><img width=50% height=50% src="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/images/injecting-game-state.png"/></p>
<p>As a C++ afficionados or a nitpicker, you may have noticed that my previous dumped game state started with the following pattern: <strong>R"(</strong>. This is indeed a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/string_literal">C++11 raw string literal</a>, meaning that I do not have to escape special characters like <strong>line feed</strong>. This raw string literal is stored in a file called <a href="https://github.com/Jiwan/meta_crush_saga/blob/master/current_state.txt">current_state.txt</a>.</p>
<p>How do we inject this current game state into a compile state? Let's just include it into the loop inputs!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// loop_inputs.hpp</span>

<span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="n">KeyboardInput</span> <span class="n">keyboard_input</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">KeyboardInput</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">KEYBOARD_INPUT</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Get the current keyboard input as a macro</span>

<span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">get_game_state_string</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]()</span> <span class="k">constexpr</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">game_state_string</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">constexpr_string</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="c1">// Include the raw string literal into a variable</span>
        <span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&quot;current_state.txt&quot;</span><span class="cp"></span>
    <span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">game_state_string</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Whether it is a <em>.txt</em> file or a <em>.h</em> file, the <strong>include</strong> directive from C preprocessor will work exactly the same: it will copy the content of the file at its location. Here I am copying the ascii-game-state-raw-string-literal into a variable named <strong>game_state_string</strong>. </p>
<p>Note that this header file <a href="https://github.com/Jiwan/meta_crush_saga/blob/master/loop_inputs.hpp">loop_inputs.hpp</a> also exposes the keyboard inputs for the current frame / compilation. Unlike the game state, the keyboard state is fairly small and can be easily received as a preprocessor definition.</p>
<h3>Compile time computation of the new state:</h3>
<p><img width=50% height=50% src="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/images/compile-time-computation-new-state.png"/></p>
<p>Now that we have gathered enough data, we can compute a new state. And finally, we reach the point where we have to write a <a href="https://github.com/Jiwan/meta_crush_saga/blob/master/main.cpp">main.cpp file</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// main.cpp</span>
<span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&quot;loop_inputs.hpp&quot; // Get all the data necessary for our computation.</span><span class="cp"></span>

<span class="c1">// Start: compile-time computation.</span>

<span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">current_state</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">parse_game_state</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">get_game_state_string</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// Parse the game state into a convenient object.</span>

<span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">new_state</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">game_engine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">current_state</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">// Feed the engine with the parsed state,</span>
    <span class="p">.</span><span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">keyboard_input</span><span class="p">);</span>                          <span class="c1">// Update the engine to obtain a new state.</span>


<span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">array</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">print_game_state</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">new_state</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// Convert the new state into a std::array&lt;char&gt; representation.</span>

<span class="c1">// End: compile-time computation.</span>

<span class="c1">// Runtime: just render the state.</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="nl">c</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">array</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>  <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">cout</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Strangely, this C++ code does not look too convoluted for what it does. Most of this code is run during the compilation phase and yet follows traditional OOP and procedural paradigms. Only the rendering, the last line, is an impediment to a pure compile-time computation. By sprinkling a bit of <strong>constexpr</strong> where it should, you can have pretty elegant meta-programming in C++17 as we will see later-on. I find it fascinating the freedom C++ gives us when it comes to mix runtime and compile-time execution.</p>
<p>You will also notice that this code only execute one frame, there is no <strong>game-loop</strong> in here. Let's solve that issue!</p>
<h3>Gluing things together:</h3>
<p><img width=50% height=50% src="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/images/gluing-things-together.png"/></p>
<p>If you are revulsed by my <strong>C++</strong> tricks, I wish you do not mind to contemplate my <strong>Bash</strong> skills. Indeed, my <strong>game loop</strong> is nothing more than a <a href="https://github.com/Jiwan/meta_crush_saga/blob/master/meta_crush_saga.sh">bash script</a> executing repeatidly some compilations.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># It is a loop! No wait, it is a game loop!!!</span>
<span class="k">while</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do</span> :

    <span class="c1"># Place the rendering into a current_state.txt file and wrap it into a raw string literal.</span>

    <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$current_state</span> &gt;&gt; current_state.txt
    <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;)\&quot;&quot;</span> &gt;&gt; current_state.txt
<span class="k">done</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I actually struggled a bit to get the keyboard inputs from the console. I initially wanted to receive the inputs in parallel of the compilation. After lots trial and error, I got something working-ish using the <code>read</code> <strong>Bash</strong> command. I would never dare to duel a <strong>Bash</strong> wizard, that language is way too maleficent!</p>
<p>Now let's agree, I had to resort to use another language to handle my game loop. Although, technically, nothing would prevent me to write that part of the code in C++. It also does not cancel the fact that 90% of the logic of my game is done within this <strong>g++</strong> compilation command, which is pretty awesome!</p>
<h3>A bit of gameplay to soften your eyes:</h3>
<p>Now that you have suffered your way into my explanations on the game's architecture, here comes a bit of eye candy:</p>
<p><img alt="Meta Crush Saga in action" src="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/images/meta-crush-saga.gif"></p>
<p>This pixelated gif is a record of me playing <strong>Meta Crush Saga</strong>. As you can see, the game runs smoothly enough to make it playable in real-time. It is clearly not attractive enough to be able to stream it on Twitch and for me to become the new Pewdiepie, but hey... it works!
One of the funny aspect of having a <strong>game state</strong> stored as a <em>.txt</em> is the ability to cheat or test edge-cases really easily.</p>
<p>Now that I sketched the architecture, we will dive a bit more in the C++17 features used within that project. I will not focus on the game logic, as it is very specific to a Match-3, but will instead discuss subjects of C++ that be could applied in other projects too.</p>
<h2>My C++17 learnings:</h2>
<p><img width=25% height=25% style="float: left;" src="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/images/spoiled-kids.png"/></p>
<p>Unlike C++14 which mainly contained minor fixes, the new C++17 standard has a lot to offer. There were hopes that some long-overdue features would land this time (modules, coroutines, concepts...) and... well... they did not ; which disappointed quite a few of us. But after the mourning, we discovered a myriad of small unexpected gems that made their way through.</p>
<p>I would dare to say that all the meta-programming kids were spoiled this year! Few minor tweaks and additions in language now permit you to write code very similar weither it is running during compilation or afterwards during runtime.</p>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<h3>Constepxr all the things:</h3>
<p>As Ben Deane and Jason Turner foretold in their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJwd4JLYJJY">C++14 talk</a>, 
C++ is quickly improving value-computations at compile-time using the almighty <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constexpr">constexpr</a> keyword. By placing this keyword in the appropriate places you can hint to your compiler that an expression is constant and <strong>could</strong> be directly evaluated at compile-time. In <strong>C++11</strong> you could already write such code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">factorial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">// Combining a function with constexpr make it potentially evaluable at compile-time.</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">?</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">factorial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">factorial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// Call to a constexpr function.</span>
<span class="c1">// Can be replace by a good compiler by:</span>
<span class="c1">// int i = 120;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>While powerful, <strong>constexpr</strong> had quite a lot of restrictions on its usage and made it cumbersome to write expressive code in this way.
<strong>C++14</strong> relaxed a lot <strong>constexpr</strong> and felt much more natural to use. Our previous factorial function could be rewritten this way:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">factorial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>Indeed, <strong>C++14</strong> lifted the rule stipulating that a <strong>constexpr function</strong> must only consist of one return statement, which forced us to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:">ternary operator</a> as a basic building block. Now <strong>C++17</strong> brought even more placements for the <strong>constexpr</strong> keyword that we can explore!</p>
<h4>Compile-time branching:</h4>
<p>Did you ever end-up in a situation where you wish that you could have different behavior according to the template parameter you are manipulating? Let's say that you wanted a generic <code>serialize</code> function that would call <code>.serialize()</code> if your object provides one, otherwise fall back on calling <code>to_string</code> on it. As explained in more details in this <a href="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/sfinae-introduction.html">post about SFINAE</a> you would very likely write such a lovely alien code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

<p>In your dreams you may be able to rewrite that awkward <strong>SFINAE trick</strong> into such a magestic piece of code in <strong>C++14</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// has_serialize is a constexpr function that test the of serialize on a object.</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Sadly, as soon as you wake-up and start writing <strong>C++14</strong> for real, your compiler will vomit you a displeasant message regarding the call <code>serialize(42);</code>. It will explain that the object <code>obj</code> of type <code>int</code> does not have a <code>serialize()</code> member function. As much as you hate it, your compiler is right! Given the current code, it will always try to compile both of the branches <code>return obj.serialize();</code> and 
<code>return std::to_string(obj);</code>. For an <code>int</code>, the branch <code>return obj.serialize();</code> might well be some dead-code since <code>has_serialize(obj)</code> will always return <code>false</code>, but your compiler will still need to compile-it.</p>
<p>As you may expect, <strong>C++17</strong> save us from such an embarassing situation by introducing the possibility to add <strong>constexpr</strong> after an if statement to "force" a compile-time branching and discard the unused statements:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// has_serialize...</span>

<p>This is clearly a huge improvement compared to the <strong>SFINAE trick</strong> we had to employ until now. After that, you will start to get the same addiction as Ben and Jason which consists in <strong>constexpr</strong> everything, everywhere at anytime. Alas, there is still one place where the <strong>constexpr</strong> keyword would well fit in but cannot be done yet: <strong>constexpr parameters</strong>.</p>
<h4>Constexpr parameters:</h4>
<p>If you are assiduous, you may have noticed a strange pattern in one my previous code sample. I am talking about the loop inputs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// loop_inputs.hpp</span>

<span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">get_game_state_string</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]()</span> <span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="c1">// Why?</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">game_state_string</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">constexpr_string</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="c1">// Include the raw string literal into a variable</span>
        <span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&quot;current_state.txt&quot;</span><span class="cp"></span>
    <span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">game_state_string</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Why is the variable <strong>game_state_string</strong> encapsulated into a constexpr lambda? Why not making it a <strong>constexpr global variable</strong>?</p>
<p>Well, I wanted to pass this variable and its content deep down to some functions. For instance, my <strong>parse_board</strong> needed to be fed with it and used it in some constant expressions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">parse_board_size</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">game_state_string</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="c1">//                                       ^ ‘game_state_string’ is not a constant expression</span>
    <span class="c1">// ...  </span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">parse_board</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">“</span><span class="p">...</span><span class="n">something</span><span class="p">...</span><span class="err">”</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you are doing it this way, your grumpy compiler will complain that the parameter <strong>game_state_string</strong> is not a constant expression. When I am building my array of Gems, I need to compute its fixed capacity directly (you cannot use vectors at compile-time as it requires to allocate) and pass it as a value-template-argument to <strong>std::array</strong>. The expression <strong>parse_board_size(game_state_string)</strong> therefore needs to be a constant expression. While <strong>parse_board_size</strong> is clearly marked as <strong>constexpr</strong>, <strong>game_state_string</strong> is not AND cannot be! Two rules are annoying us in this case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arguments of a constexpr function are not constexpr!</li>
<li>And you cannot add constexpr in front of them!</li>
</ul>
<p>It boils down to the fact that <strong>constexpr functions</strong> MUST be usable for both runtime or compile-time computations. Allowing <strong>constexpr parameters</strong> would discard the possibility to use them at runtime.</p>
<p><center><img width=25% height=25% src="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/images/facepalm.jpg"/></center></p>
<p>Thanksfully, there is a way to mitigate that issue. Instead of accepting the value as a normal function parameter, you can encapsulate that value into a type and pass that type as a template parameter:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">GameStringType</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">parse_board</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">GameStringType</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">array</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">CellType</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">parse_board_size</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">GameStringType</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">())</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">board</span><span class="p">{};</span>
    <span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">GameString</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">&quot;...something...&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="n">parse_board</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">GameString</span><span class="p">{});</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In this code sample, I am creating a struct type <strong>GameString</strong> which has a static constexpr member function <strong>value()</strong> that returns the string literal I want to pass to <strong>parse_board</strong>. In <strong>parse_board</strong> I receive this type through the template parameter <strong>GameStringType</strong> thanks to template argument deduction rules. Having <strong>GameStringType</strong>, I can simply call the static member function <strong>value()</strong> whenever I want to get the string literal, even in locations where constant expressions are necessary since <strong>value()</strong> is constexpr. </p>
<p>We succeeded to encapsulate our literal to somehow pass it to <strong>parse_board</strong> in a constexpr way. Now, it gets very annoying to have to define a new type everytime you want to send a new literal to <strong>parse_board</strong>: "...something1...", "...something2...". To solve that issue in <strong>C++11</strong>, you can rely on some ugly macros and few indirection using an anonymous union and a lambda. Mikael Park has a nice explanation on this topic in <a href="https://mpark.github.io/programming/2017/05/26/constexpr-function-parameters/">one of his post</a>. </p>
<p>We can do even better in <strong>C++17</strong>. If you list our current requirements to pass our string literal, we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A generated function</li>
<li>Which is constexpr</li>
<li>With a unique or anonymous name</li>
</ul>
<p>This requirements should ring a bell to you. What we need is a <strong>constexpr lambda</strong>! And <strong>C++17</strong> rightfully added the possibility to use the <strong>constexpr</strong> keyword on a lambda. We could rewrite the code sample in such a way:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">LambdaType</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

    <span class="c1">//                                       ^ Allowed to call a constexpr lambda in this context.</span>

<span class="c1">//                ^ Make our lambda constexpr.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Believe me, this feels already much neater than the previous <strong>C++11</strong> hackery using macros. I discovered this awesome trick thanks to <strong>Björn Fahller</strong>, a member of the C++ meetup group I participate in. You can read more about this trick on his <a href="http://playfulprogramming.blogspot.se/2016/08/strings-as-types-with-c17-constexpr.html">blog</a>. Note also that the <strong>constexpr</strong> keyword is actually not necessary in this case: all the <strong>lambdas</strong> with the capacity to be <strong>constexpr</strong> will be by default. Having an explicit <strong>constexpr</strong> in the signature just makes it easier to catch mistakes.</p>
<p>Now you should understand why I was forced to use a <strong>constexpr</strong> lambda to pass down the string representing my game state. Have a look at this lambda and one question should arise again. What is this <strong>constexpr_string</strong> type I also use to wrap the string literal?</p>
<h5><strong>constexpr_string</strong> and <strong>constexpr_string_view</strong>:</h5>
<p>When you are dealing with strings, you do not want to deal with them the C way. All these pesky algorithms iterating in a raw manner and checking null ending should be forbidden! The alternative offered by <strong>C++</strong> is the almighty <strong>std::string</strong> and <strong>STL algorithms</strong>. Sadly, <strong>std::string</strong> may have to allocate on the heap (even with Small String Optimization) to store their content. One or two standards from now we may benefit from <strong>constexpr new/delete</strong> or being able to pass <strong>constexpr allocators</strong> to <strong>std::string</strong>, but for now we have to find another solution.</p>
<p>My approach was to write a <strong>constexpr_string</strong> class which has a fixed capacity. This capacity is passed as a value template parameter. Here is a short overview of my class:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="kt">size_t</span> <span class="n">N</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="c1">// N is the capacity of my string.</span>

</pre></div>


<p>My <a href="https://github.com/Jiwan/meta_crush_saga/blob/master/constexpr_string.hpp">constexpr_string</a> class tries to mimic as closely as possible the interface of <strong>std::string</strong> (for the operations that I needed): you can query the <strong>begin and end iterators</strong>, retrive the <strong>size</strong>, get access to <strong>data</strong>, <strong>erase</strong> part of it, get a substring using <strong>substr</strong>, etc. It makes it very straightforward to transform a piece of code from <strong>std::string</strong> to <strong>constexpr_string</strong>. You may wonder what happens when you want to do use operations that would normally requires an allocation in <strong>std::string</strong>. In such cases, I was forced to transform them into <strong>immutable operations</strong> that would create new instance of <strong>constexpr_string</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at the <strong>append</strong> operation:</p>

<p>No needs to have a Fields Medal to assume that if we have a string of size <strong>N</strong> and a string or size <strong>M</strong>, a string of size <strong>N + M</strong> should be enough to store the concatenation. You may waste a bit of "compile-time storage" since both of your strings may not use their full capacity, but that is a fairly small price to pay for a lot of convenience. I, obviously, also wrote the counterpart of <strong>std::string_view</strong> which I named <a href="https://github.com/Jiwan/meta_crush_saga/blob/master/constexpr_string_view.hpp">constexpr_string_view</a>.</p>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<p>Having these two classes, I was ready to write elegant code to parse my <strong>game state</strong>. Think about something like that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">game_state</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">constexpr_string</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">“</span><span class="p">...</span><span class="n">something</span><span class="p">...</span><span class="err">”</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="c1">// Let&#39;s find the first blue gem occurence within my string:</span>
<span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">blue_gem</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">find_if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">game_state</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">begin</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">game_state</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">end</span><span class="p">(),</span>

<span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It was fairly simple to iterate over the gems on my board - speaking of which, did you notice another <strong>C++17</strong> gem in that code sample?</p>
<p>Yes! I did not have to explicitely specify the capacity of my <strong>constexpr_string</strong> when constructing it. In the past, you had to explicitely specify the arguments of a <strong>class template</strong> when using it. To avoid this pain, we would provide <em>make_xxx</em> functions since parameters of <strong>function templates</strong> could be deduced. Have a look on how <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/class_template_argument_deduction">class template argument deduction</a> is changing our life for the better:</p>

<p>In some tricky situations, you may still need to help your compiler to deduce correctly your arguments.

<h4>Free food from the STL:</h4>
<p>Alright, you can always rewrite things by yourself. But did the committee members kindly cooked something for us in the standard library?</p>
<h5>New utility types:</h5>
<p><strong>C++17</strong> introduced <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant">std::variant</a> and <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional">std::optional</a> to the common vocabulary types, with <strong>constexpr</strong> in mind. While the former one is really interesting since it permits you to express type-safe unions, the implementation provided in the <strong>libstdc++</strong> library with <strong>GCC 7.2</strong> had issues when used in constant expressions. Therefore, I gave up the idea to introduce <strong>std::variant</strong> in my code and solely utilised <strong>std::optional</strong>.</p>
<p>Given a type <strong>T</strong>, <strong>std::optional</strong> allows you to create a new type <strong>std::optional<T></strong> which may either hold a value of type <strong>T</strong> or nothing. It is pretty similar to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/">nullable value types</a> in <strong>C#</strong>.
Let's consider a <strong>find_in_board</strong> function that return the position of the first item in the board that validate a predicate. You may not have such an item in the board at all. To handle such a situation, the position type must be optional:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Predicate</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Previously, you would have recourse to either <strong>pointer semantics</strong> or add an "empty state" directly into your position type or return a boolean and take an <strong>out parameter</strong>. Let's face it, it was pretty clumsy!</p>
<p>Some already existing types also received a <strong>constexpr</strong> lifting: <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple">tuple</a> and <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/pair">pair</a>. I will not explain their usage as a lot have been already written on these two, but I will share you one of my disapointment. The committee added to the standard a <strong>syntactic sugar</strong> to extract the values hold by a <strong>tuple</strong> or <strong>pair</strong>. Called <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/structured_binding">structured binding</a>, this new kind of declaration uses brackets to define in which variables you would like to store the exploded <strong>tuple</strong> or <strong>pair</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">pair</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1337</span><span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">auto</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="c1">// x = 42 and y = 1337.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Really clever! It is just a pity that the committee members [could not, would not, did not have the time, forgot, enjoyed not] to make it <strong>constexpr</strong> friendly. I would have expected something along the way:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="k">auto</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// OR</span>
<span class="k">auto</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We now have fancy containers and utilities, how can we manipulate them easily?</p>
<h5>Algorithms:</h5>
<p>Upgrading a container to a handle <strong>constexpr</strong> is a rather tedious work. Comparatively, bringing <strong>constexpr</strong> to <strong>non-modifying algorithms</strong> seems rather straightforward. But strangely enough, <strong>C++17</strong> did not see any progress in that domain, it is actually coming in <strong>C++20</strong>. For instance, the supreme <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/find">std::find</a> algorithms did not receive its <strong>constexpr</strong> signature.</p>
<p>Worry not (or "Qu'à cela ne tienne" in French)! As explained by Ben and Jason, you can easily turn an algorithm in <strong>constexpr</strong> by simply copying a current implementation (checkout for copyrights though) ; cppreference being a good fit. Ladies and gentlemen, I present you a <strong>constexpr std::find</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">InputIt</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

<span class="c1">// ^ TADAMMMM!!! I added constexpr here.</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(;</span> <span class="n">first</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">last</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="o">++</span><span class="n">first</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>I already hear optimisation affionados screaming on their chair! Yes, just adding <strong>constexpr</strong> in front of a code sample gently provided by <strong>cppreference</strong> may not give you the perfect <strong>runtime performances</strong>. But if we really had to polish this algorithm it would be for <strong>compile-time performances</strong>. Keeping things simple usually give the best results when it comes to speed of <strong>compilation</strong> from what I observed.</p>
<h3>Performance &amp; bugs:</h3>
<p>Every triple A games must put efforts in these topics, right?</p>
<h4>Performance:</h4>
<p>When I achieved a first half-workingish version of <strong>Meta Crush Saga</strong> things ran rather smoothly. It actually reached a bit more than <strong>3 FPS</strong> (Frame Per Second) on my old laptop with an i5 clocked at 1.80GHz (frequency do matter in this case). As in any project, I quickly found my previously written code unsavoury and started to rewrite the parsing of my game state using <strong>constexpr_string</strong> and standard algorithms. Although it made my code much more maintenable it also had a severe impact on the performance ; <strong>0.5 FPS</strong> was the new ceiling. </p>
<p><center><img width=35% height=35% src="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/images/performance-rating.png"/></center></p>
<p>Unlike the old C++ adage, "zero-head abstractions" did not apply to <strong>compile-time computations</strong>. Which really makes sense if you see your compiler as an interpreter of some "compile-time code". There is still room to improve for the various compilers, but also for us writers of such code. Here is a non-exhaustive list of few observations and tips, maybe specific to GCC, that I figured out:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>C arrays</strong> performed significantly better than <strong>std::array</strong>. <strong>std::array</strong> is a bit of modern C++ cosmetic over a <strong>C-style array</strong> and one must pay a certain price to use it in such circumstances. </li>
<li>It felt like <strong>recursive functions</strong> had the advantage (speed-wise) over writing <strong>functions with loops</strong>. It could well be that writing recursive algorithms forces you to tackle your problems in another way, which behaves better. To put in my two penny worth, I believe that the cost of compile-time calls might be smaller than executing a complicated function body especially that compilers (and their implementors) have been exposed to decades of abusive recursions we used for our own template-metaprogramming ends. </li>
<li>Copying data around is also quite expensive, notably if you are dealing with value types. If I wanted to futher optimise my game, I would mainly focus on that problem.</li>
<li>I only <s>ab</s>used one of my CPU core to do the job. Having only one compilation unit restricted me to spawn only one instance of GCC at a time. I am not quite sure if you could parallelise my compilutation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bugs:</h4>
<p><img width=20% height=20% style="float: left;" src="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/images/no-bugs.png"/>
More than once, my compiler regurgitated terrible compilation errors, my code logic being flawed. But how could I find where the bug was located? Without <strong>debugger</strong> and <strong>printf</strong>, things get complicated. If your metaphoric programming beard is not up to your knees (both my metaphoric and physical one did not reach the expectations), you may not have the motivation to use <a href="https://github.com/mikael-s-persson/templight">templight</a> nor to debug your compiler.</p>
<p>Your first friend will be <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/static_assert">static_assert</a>, which gives you the possibility to test the value of a compile-time boolean. Your second friend will be a macro to turn on and off <strong>constexpr</strong> wherever possible:
<div style="clear: both;"></div></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">#define CONSTEXPR constexpr  </span><span class="c1">// compile-time No debug possible</span>

<span class="c1">// OR</span>

<span class="cp">#define CONSTEXPR           </span><span class="c1">// Debug at runtime</span>
</pre></div>


<p>By using this macro, you can force the logic to execute at runtime and therefore attach a debugger to it.</p>
<h2>Meta Crush Saga II - Looking for a pure compile-time experience:</h2>
<p>Clearly, <strong>Meta Crush Saga</strong> will not win <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_Awards">The Game Awards</a> this year. It has some great potential, but the experience is not fully <strong>compile-time</strong> YET, which may be a showstopper for hardcore gamers... I cannot get rid-of the bash script, unless someone add <strong>keyboard inputs</strong> and impure logic during the compilation-phase (pure madness!). But I believe, that one day, I could entirely bypass the <strong>renderer</strong> executable and print my <strong>game state</strong> at <strong>compile-time</strong>:</p>
<p><img alt="Life cycle of a fully compile-time game" src="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/images/life-cycle-fully-compile-time-game.png"></p>
<p>A crazy fellow pseudo-named <strong>saarraz</strong>, <a href="https://github.com/saarraz/static-print">extended GCC</a> to add a <strong>static_print</strong> statement to the language. This statement would take a few constant expressions or string literals and output them during the compilation. I would be glad if such tool would be added to the standard, or at least extend <strong>static_assert</strong> to accept constant expressions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there might be a <strong>C++17</strong> way to obtain that result. Compilers already ouput two things, <strong>errors</strong> and <strong>warnings</strong>! If we could somehow control or bend a <strong>warning</strong> to our needs, we may already have a decent output. I tried few solutions, notably the <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/attributes">deprecated attribute</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">char</span><span class="p">...</span> <span class="n">words</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

<p>I would like to thanks the <strong>SwedenCpp team</strong> for letting me having my talk on this project during one of their event. And I particularly would like to express my gratitude to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandre-gordeev/">Alexandre Gourdeev</a> who helped me improve <strong>Meta Crush Saga</strong> in quite a few significant aspects.</p>

      <p>Here is a quick follow-up of the event I announced in my previous <a href="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/distributed-c++-meetup.html">post</a>: the <strong>Distributed C++ Meetup 0x02</strong>. A quick explanation for those too lazy to click a link or scroll down a bit to read my previous post (not judging you here, I would do the same); the concept of a Distibuted C++ Meetup consists in gathering multiple C++ user groups from around the world in one event using video-conference facilities. This time we had the pleasure to bring together the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/berlincplusplus/">Berlin</a>, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CppLondon/">London</a> and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/swedencpp/">Stockholm</a> Meetup groups using <a href="https://king.com/">King's</a> offices.</p>
<h3>Distributed C++ Meetup 0x02:</h3>
<p>Once again <strong>Phil Nash</strong> took on himself to edit a full footage of the event, which you can enjoy right here:</p>

<p><strong>Harald Achitz</strong> gently explained us the <a href="http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2017/p0515r0.pdf">space-ship operator</a> that will arrive in C++20 and what to expect from it. Then came the introduction on <strong>Type Safe Flags</strong> made by <strong>Arvid Norberg</strong> that I particulary enjoyed : simple and very practical! <strong>Richard Spindler</strong> related us his experience with <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/compute/doc/html/index.html">Boost.Compute</a>. Finally, <strong>Dominic Jones</strong> made a talk on <strong>Expression Tree Transform</strong> which reminded me a lot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYNRoeWJuAw">Reactive Equations by André Bergner</a> that I had the chance to see during <strong>Meeting C++ 2017</strong>. Although, I always enjoy template meta-programming, it was very alien to anyone at the event who wasn't familiar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_templates">expression templates</a>. I always admire anyone willing to be on stage to share her/his knowledge and I appreciate the honor our speakers did to us by doing so that evening.</p>
<h3>Polirazed opinions:</h3>
<p>As the tradition goes, we sent a survey after our Meetup event. The feedback we received was substantially more divided than last time. Although the numbers indicate that a majority of the people are willing to redo such an event ; 47.50% really want a re-run, 35.00% liked it as much as a normal event, 17.50% would have prefer to stick to a normal one; it was clearly less popular than the last event with respectively 82.50%, 15% and 2%. Surprisingly people changed their minds and now would prefer going back to lightning talks (instead of 30min ones), as suggested by few feedback comments. As a comparison you can also read more about the previous event's results on Phil Nash's <a href="http://www.levelofindirection.com/journal/2017/11/6/the-worlds-first-distributed-c-meet-up.html">blog</a>. People also expressed a strong feeling of being less "connected with the remote crowd" this time, which is sadly one of our main goal for a Distributed Meetup. It was especially surprising that this time we had questions crossing the virtual borders.</p>
<p>I have been reflecting on what changed in our event's recipe and what could have be done better. Here are my thoughs as well as observations from other co-organizers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The more cities we gather, the less time each location has talks happening physically in front of them. No matter how good is the video-conference setup, anyone would prefer to have it "at home". While as an attendee you will appreciate spending <strong>half</strong> of the event learning from speakers at another location, <strong>two-thirds</strong> of the event might be too long. Having more cities also increase the risk of cumulating technical issues. I would suggest to come back to a two cities format.</li>
<li>We need to have room for a break in our schedule. Even Supertemplateman would not stand two hours of C++ talks on a cramped bench. Having 15min to make our transitions between countries would be pretty sweet too.</li>
<li>Lightning talks may be somehow frustrating as they barely touch the surface of a topic. But a 35min talk can also be pretty damn long if you do not like the subject, even more so when projected on a screen. We would like to try 15min for a next run of the event. Shorter talks also have a desirable side effect: speakers will tend to write slides that are very expressive. Which bring us to the next issue.</li>
<li>I noticed that slides were much harder to read especially on the weird 4-TVs setup we have in the Stockholm's office. This was corroborated by the feedback specific to Stockholm. Tiny fonts force you to concentrate to extrapolate information that you cannot obtain with your eyes, it's exhausting and frustrating. We should really advise the speakers to use a minimum font size prior to the event. There is also the possibility to have multiple screens in the Stockholm office, to improve the experience for the people that always sit in our very attractive carousels in the back (every King employee did that mistake once).</li>
<li>People don't like the mandatory NDA to access the London office. I am not sure how this could be solved, as I am not familiar to this office. Be sure that we will explore that topic later on.</li>
<li>Finally, as a reminder, never forget to turn the light on! As much as we are used to darkness in Sweden, it was still a challenge for us to see what happened in the tenebrous London office. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>I would like to run a third <strong>Distributed C++ Meetup</strong> with the aforementioned "bug-fixes". I am eager to see if the concept is actually viable or if the first run was simply benefiting from the novelty effect. As we are pioneer in these virtual meetups, it is pretty obvious that we will have to <s>use our attendees as guinea pigs</s> slowly refine our ideas .</p>
<p>Thanks to all people that helped during this event: Mårten Möller, Vasil Georgiev, Phil Nash, Harald Achitz, Tindy Hellman, Bruno Mikus, our tech and video-crew...</p>

  <div>
      <p>As mentioned in an early <a href="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/c++-stockholm-0x02.html">post</a>, I am active member of a C++ Meetup group in Stockholm: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/swedencpp/">SwedenCpp</a>. Last year me and the main organizer of <strong>SwedenCpp</strong> came up with the idea to gather different Meetup groups from Europe for a special event. Knowing that we are not as famous as the <a href="https://cppcon.org/">cppcon</a>, and therefore could not attract people easily to come to visit us in our dark and cold country, we had to come up with a special plan. It happens that my current company <a href="https://discover.king.com/about/">King</a> has offices of decent size in few of the major tech hubs of Europe: Berlin, Stockholm, London and Barcelona. It also happens that we have pretty good video-conference facilities that we frequently use to do company-wide calls. AND It also happens that a huge share of the mobile games (Candy Crush Saga, Bubble Witch Saga...) made at <strong>King</strong> rely heavily on a <strong>C++</strong> tech stack. By using the video-conference facilities, having some drinks and food, all gently provided by <strong>King</strong>, we were confident that we could run an event with multiple Meetup groups participating remotely and have a lot of fun.</p>
<p>And thus was born the concept of a <strong>Distributed C++ Meetup</strong>!</p>
<p>We contacted the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CppLondon/events/248091281/">London Meetup group</a> and asked them if they wanted to join us in this aventure. Sure enough, Phil Nash, the organizer, said yes. Greatly helped by few colleagues (Mårten Möller, Tindy Hellman, Bruno Mikus, Brittany Pinder...) we ran a first event in November 2017 with a connection between London and Stockholm. </p>
<h3>Distributed C++ Meetup 0x01:</h3>
<p>Here is a full video of the first event (Distributed C++ Meetup 0x01) where we had lightning talks from speakers on both sites:</p>
<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vIVZsVneVDg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Or if you want to see some specific talks, you can also watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBKFkLKL89uLmO22p7vWVrWO5eGzDM7PE">youtube playlist</a> with videos nicely crafted by our amazing <strong>SwedenCpp</strong> video crew.</p>
<p>I was pretty nervous to be the host of the event, but I think that everything ran pretty smoothly and the vast majority of the attendees enjoyed the concept. 
We had few learnings though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some people prefer the long format for the talks instead of lightning talks we used this time.</li>
<li>I had a failed attempt in creating an interaction between the crowd and the speakers. No one really dares to speak to remote speakers! This could be solved by using apps like slido.</li>
<li>It always nice to use have backups for video recording and sound recording. The audio recorded in London was not as good as expected.</li>
<li>Do not drink the beers and ciders originally bought for the halloween party!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Distributed C++ Meetup 0x02:</h3>
<p>The reason I decided to write about this event few months after is that 1) I am lazy 2) we will soon have another run of this concept.
Next week, on the 28th of March 2018, the Distributed C++ Meetup 0x02 will happen. This time not only London and Stockholm will be involved but we also bring with us the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/berlincplusplus/">Berlin Meetup Group</a> managed by Sebastian Theophil and Vasil Georgiev (from King)!</p>
<p>If you are reading this post and want to join the event, it is still not too late to sign-up:</p>

      <p>Finally, after years of watching youtube videos on that topic, I made it to my first <strong>C++</strong> international conference!
Thanks to my current employer <a href="https://discover.king.com/about/">King</a>, I went last week to <a href="http://meetingcpp.com/">Meeting C++</a> in <strong>Berlin</strong>, which is, as far as I know, the biggest <strong>C++</strong> event in Europe. I really enjoyed my time there with few hundred other fellow <strong>C++</strong> enthusiasts. In this post, I will try to relate how I experienced the event and dress a list of the must-watch talks.</p>
<h1>About meeting C++:</h1>
<h2>The concept:</h2>
<p><img style="float: right;" width=200 height=250 src="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/images/badge.jpg"/></p>
<p>Held in the magnificient <a href="http://meetingcpp.com/2017/Location.html">Andels Hotel</a> in <strong>Berlin</strong>, <strong>Meeting C++</strong> offers the possibility to attend keynotes, talks and lightning talks (respectively lasting 2 hours, 50min and 5min) about our favourite language <strong>C++</strong> for 3 days (one extra day added for the 6th edition of the event). <strong>C++</strong> being multi-paradigm and a general-purpose programming language, the variety of the topics being discussed is pretty wide. It ranges from subject on "(Template) Meta-programming" to a deep dive on "How a C++ debugger work", from begginner friendly talks to hairy discussions on the yet-to-be-standardised white paper on <strong>std::expected&lt;T, E></strong>.</p>
<p>As some talks happen simulteanously in different rooms, you cannot physically attend all the talks. Instead, you would usually prepare your own schedule by trying to guess the content of the talks from their summary. It is always a dilemna to choose between a topic that you like with the risk to have nothing new to learn, and a brand-new topic for you, where sleepness may kick-in midway to the presentation. If you are curious and daring, the lightning talks on the last day permit you to randomly discover antyhing about C++ in succint presentations. In any case, you can always catch-up the missed talks by checking the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MeetingCPP">Youtube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Generally, I was not disapointed by the quality of the slides and the speakers. I picked up quite a few new concepts, prepared myself for the future of <strong>C++</strong> (C++20) and refreshed myself on some fields I did not touch for a while.</p>
<h2>More than just talks:</h2>
<p>Where <strong>Meeting C++</strong> really shines is in its capacity to gather roughly 600 passionated developers from various backgrounds (university, gaming industry, finance, Sillicon Valley's giants...) in one building and <strong>share</strong>. Just share anything about C++, about reverse-engineering, about your job, about your country, about the german food in your plate! The C++ community represented at this event is very active, open-minded and willing to help. The catering between the sessions and the dinner parties permit you to meet anyone easily. The even team also oganises some really fun events</p>
<p>In a room full of "world-class developers", it is easy to be intimidated, but you should not hesitate to reach them. They will not nitpick your words nor snob you. For some people, it is a dream to meet an Hollywood Star in the street, for me it was really delightful to have casual conversations with these "legendary" coders from the web.</p>
<h1>The chief's suggestions of the day:</h1>
<p>Here is a menu of most of the talks I attended. The legend is pretty simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>💀 : The difficulty of the talk (💀: Begginer friendly, 💀💀: Intermediate, 💀💀💀: High exposure to C++'s dark corners)</li>
<li>★ : My interest for the talk (★: Good talk, ★★: Tasty talk, ★★★: Legendary talk)</li>
</ul>
<p>I will not spoil all the talks, but simply try to give an overview of what you can expect within them. Note that all the talks are generally of high quality and my appreciation very subjective. I have seen people with very different "favorite talk".</p>
<h3>[Keynote] Better Code: Human interface - By Sean Parent - 💀 ★★</h3>
<ul>
<li>Slides: <a href="https://github.com/sean-parent/sean-parent.github.io/blob/master/presentations/2017-11-09-human-interface/2017-11-09-human-interface.pdf">link</a></li>
<li>Video: <a href="">coming-soon</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sean Parent is a Principal Scientist at Adobe Systems and has been working on the famous software <strong>Photoshop</strong> for more than 15 years. Sean Parent is a regular and prominent speaker at C++ conferences, one of his recently most famous talk being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGcVXgEVMJg">Better Code: Runtime Polyphormism</a> from the same series of talks (Better Code) as the one he gave during <strong>Meeting C++</strong>.</p>
<p>Thorough his keynote, Sean was conveing the message that in order to have ergonomic human interfaces, you must design your code to reflects its usage through UI. By following such a principle, one can easily come-up with good namings, semantics and grouping of your UI components.</p>
<p>For instance, Sean was explaining that most of the menu actions in <strong>Photoshop</strong> somehow mapped some object, their methods, properties and most importantly their <strong>relations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The menu action <strong>Create New Layer</strong> will somehow call the constructor of a class called something like <strong>Layer</strong>.</li>
<li>Likewise the action <strong>Delete A Layer</strong> would call its destructor.</li>
<li>A selection in <strong>Photoshop</strong> will most likely translate in a container of objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a counter-example he explained that the old version of <strong>Gmail</strong> used to have a confusing flow when it comes to the most trivial usage of a mail service: creating a mail. A <strong>link</strong>, which implies <strong>navigation</strong>, was used instead of <strong>button</strong> for the "compose message" action.</p>
<p><img alt="Gmail failed compose button" src="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/images/gmail-failure.png"></p>
<p>Sean put a strong emphasis that relationships are the most difficult part of an architecture to represent. He came up with few examples on how <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/stable_partition">std::stable_partition</a> can be used to solve in an elegant way the gathering and display of items </p>
<p>Overall a very nice talk, but on a very abstract topic, since not much has been explored on that subject yet! This is worth paying attention in game-programming where a good UI is a key-part of the success of a game.</p>
<h2>[Talk] Threads and Locks must Go - Rainer Grimm - 💀💀 ★</h2>
<ul>
<li>Slides: <a href="">coming-soon</a></li>
<li>Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkqVRzy4JhA">link</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this talk <strong>Rainer Grimm</strong>, a German author of multiple <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7496329.Rainer_Grimm">C++ books</a>, brought under the spotlight the concurrency features introduced by the new C++ standard <strong>C++17</strong> and the coming one <strong>C++20</strong>. Here is a short summary of my favourite features:</p>
<h3>For C++17 (and concurrency TS):</h3>
<ul>
<li>The new parallel algorithms in <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm">&lt;algorithm></a> and the associated execution policies <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/execution_policy_tag_t">seq, par and par_unseq</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">vector</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{...};</span> <span class="c1">// A bit vector... </span>
<span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">sort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">execution</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">par</span><span class="p">{},</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">begin</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">end</span><span class="p">());</span>
<span class="c1">// Due to &quot;par&quot;, this **might** execute the sort in parallel using a thread pool of some sort.</span>
</pre></div>


<ul>
<li>The new <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/future">std::future</a> interface which permits to add continuations to the shared state using the <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/future/then">then member function</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">future</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="n">f</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">then</span><span class="p">([](</span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">future</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="o">&gt;&amp;</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Will be called when f is done.</span>
    <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">cout</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// Will therefore not block.</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Hopefully for C++20:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The stackless <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4680.pdf">coroutines</a> as implemented by MSVC and clang. This introduce two keywords <strong>co_await</strong> and <strong>co_yield</strong>. Considering the previous example using std::future, it could be rewritten in the following way:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">future</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">co_await</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// The continuation is &quot;generated&quot; by the compiler using the keyword co_await.</span>
<span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">cout</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Everything after co_await is implicitely part of the continuation.</span>
</pre></div>


<ul>
<li>A new <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/transactional_memory">synchronized keyword</a> applying the transactional memory concept on a group of statements.</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Global vars</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="c1">// Foo can be called by multiple thread simuteanously.</span>
    <span class="c1">// Reads-writes on x and y are now thread-safe and synchronized.</span>
    <span class="n">synchronized</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="o">++</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span> 
        <span class="o">++</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As explained by <strong>Rainer Grimm</strong>, we will have the possibility to easily bring concurrency to our C++ codebases without ressorting to the low-level, and tricky to get right, features like thread and locks. While I appreciated the talk, it lacked a bit of novelty as I was already aware of most of the features.</p>
<h2>[Talk] Strong types for strong interfaces - Johnathan Boccora -  💀 ★★★</h2>
<ul>
<li>Related blog post: <a href="https://www.fluentcpp.com/2016/12/08/strong-types-for-strong-interfaces/">link</a></li>
<li>Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVleZqzTw2k&amp;t=1536s">link</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>must watch</strong>! Even when facing some technical issues,  <strong>Johnathan</strong> is very good speaker and I was quickly captivated by the topic of <strong>strong types</strong>. Jonathan is also a talented writer with his famous blog <a href="https://www.fluentcpp.com/">fluentcpp</a> (I would really suggest to have a look at it once in a while).</p>
<p>As C++ developers, we heavily rely on the language's type system to express our intentions to other developers, to optimise our code and avoid shooting ourselves into our feet. Yet, we always reuse some <strong>types</strong> to express very different properties of our system. For instance to describe a person, you would use an <strong>int</strong> for her/his age and his/her weight. Did it ever come to you that the unit <strong>year</strong> (for age) should be a very different type than <strong>kg</strong> (for weight)? The concept of <strong>strong type</strong> would solve this problem by introducing new int-compatible types:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> <span class="c1">// We need to have these empty tag types to create entirely new types and not just weakly-typed aliases.</span>
<span class="k">using</span> <span class="n">kg</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">strong_type</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">KgTag</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">using</span> <span class="n">years</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">strong_type</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">YearsTag</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">unsafe_create_person</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">age</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">weight</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">create_person</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">years</span> <span class="n">age</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">kg</span> <span class="n">weight</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// Explicit interface.</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">age</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">weight</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1337</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="n">unsafe_create_person</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">weight</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">age</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// Oops I inversed the arguments but no compiler error.</span>

<span class="n">create_person</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">years</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">age</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">kg</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">weight</span><span class="p">)));</span> <span class="c1">// Much less error-prone.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As a bonus, <strong>strong types</strong> can actually affect positively the performances of your codebase as the compiler can agressively optimise without violating <a href="http://cellperformance.beyond3d.com/articles/2006/06/understanding-strict-aliasing.html">strict-aliasing rules</a>, since the types are now strictly unrelated.</p>
<p>This concept is not new and is already used in <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono">std::chrono</a> or <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_65_1/doc/html/boost_units.html">Boost.Unit</a>, but it was really refreshing to have an explanation with simple words and good examples! I am now very keen to use this in my personal projects and at work too.</p>

<p><strong>Simon Brand</strong>, also known as <a href="https://blog.tartanllama.xyz/">TartanLlama</a> (a really fancy fictious name for a Scott), presented us how a mixture of calls to <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace</a>, injection of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INT_(x86_instruction)">int3 opcode</a>, parsing of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWARF">DWARF format</a> and perseverance is the base to create a debugger on a <strong>x86</strong>(_64) architecture with a <strong>Unix</strong> platform (or <strong>Linux</strong> platform only if you OS specific calls like <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/process_vm_readv.2.html">process_vm_readv, process_vm_writev</a>).</p>
<p>Unlike some of the other talks, it would be hard to give succinct code examples, but I trully appreciated his presentation! When it comes to low-level APIs for debbuging and reverse-engineering, I have a better understanding of the Windows platform. I think that <strong>Simon</strong> did an excellent job to help me transfer my knowledge to the Unix world.</p>
<p>If one day I have to tackle the creation of a debugger on Unix, I would certainely come back to this talk or follow his series of <a href="https://blog.tartanllama.xyz/writing-a-linux-debugger-setup/">blog posts</a> on the same subject. I also think that as programmer, it is always beneficial to have some knowledge on the underlying mechanims of the tools you use (gdb, or lldb in that case). I would, therefore suggest to watch that talk to any C++ enthusiast willing to progress in their art of programming.</p>

<p>I am always excited by watching a talk from <a href="https://twitter.com/joel_f?lang=en">Joel Falcou</a>: he is a venerable (template) metra-programmer wizzard with a very didactic approach to explain things (and also we share the same nationality \O/). Once again, I was not disapointed by his session.</p>
<p>With a lot of humour, Joel introduced a new facet to <strong>meta-programming</strong> in C++. We used to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming">template meta-programming</a> to manipulate types at compile-time (and with difficulties values), then came <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constexpr">constexpr</a> to ease value computation, and recently a <strong>Louis Dionne</strong> came-up with a powerful combo of these two cadrants with <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/libs/hana/doc/html/index.html#tutorial-introduction-quadrants">Boost.Hana</a>. <strong>Joel</strong> statement was that <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda">lambdas expressions</a> combined with <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/auto">auto</a> and <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/parameter_pack">parameter packs</a> are powerful enough to replace some cases where we would have resort to use <strong>template meta-programming</strong> or the uglier infamous <strong>macros</strong>! <strong>Joel</strong> came to that conclusion after being inspired by the language <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/ML/MetaOCaml.html">MetaOCaml</a>.</p>
<p>Let's say that you want to fill a vector with push-back instruction generated at compile-time:</p>

<p>This example is fairly trivial and there would be a high chance that you would reach the same assembly output using a simple <strong>for loop</strong>. But it is very interesting to notice that <strong>lambdas</strong> are reusable type-safe <strong>units of code</strong> that you transport, combine and "instantiate" at any time. Performance-wise, <strong>lambdas</strong> are pretty incredible according to Joel's measurement on his linear-algebra project. <strong>C++17</strong> <strong>constexpr lambdas</strong> could also help on that topic. One drawback might be the debugging complexity when navigating in nested lambdas. I still need to wrap my head around this new concept and I am eager to rewatch Joel's talk to explore it more!</p>

<p>While excellent, <a href="http://www.gregcons.com/kateblog/">Kate</a>'s keynote would be very hard to summarise correctly within few paragraphs. It makes you reflect on the difficulties to introduce <strong>C++</strong> to newcomers. You would hope that there is a subset of the language that could be easily assimilate by anyone, <strong>Kate</strong> argues that the reality is sadly more <strong>complicated</strong> than that. Just have a look at how long are the <a href="http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#fcall-parameter-passing">C++ core guidelines</a> on passing parameters to function calls. One day or another, a begginer must learn on how to pass parameters with good semantics and in an optimised fashio. Well, good luck to her/him! On the other hand, it does not mean that the language could have been designed in a simpler way. What we should strive for instead might be better naming of these concepts: the acronym <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii">RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)</a> is obviously not as straightforward as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write">COW (Copy-on-write)</a>. Whether you are a "newbie" or the best "lead over-engineer" of your company, this talk is really worth a look!</p>
<h2>[Talk] There Is A New Future - Felix Petriconi - 💀💀 ★★</h2>
<ul>
<li>Slides: <a href="">coming-soon</a></li>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://petriconi.net/?author=1">Felix Petriconi</a> and <strong>Sean Parent</strong> have been working on a the <a href="http://stlab.cc/libraries/concurrency/">stlab</a> library for quite some time. <strong>stlab</strong> takes the best of the various <strong>future</strong> implementations <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/future">std::future (C++11)</a>, <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/future">std::future (C++14)</a> or <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_65_0/doc/html/thread/synchronization.html#thread.synchronization.futures">boost::future</a>, and adds a bit of it owns features on top of it. For instance, <strong>stlabs</strong> supports passing explicit executors to control where <a href="http://stlab.cc/libraries/concurrency/future/async.html">async</a> will execute the tasks, and where the continuation associated with <a href="http://stlab.cc/libraries/concurrency/future/future/then.html">then</a> will be executed too. <strong>Executors</strong> are akin to <strong>event-loops</strong> (or message-pumps in the .Net world) that will process the tasks.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// This task will be executed on ``an_executor``</span>
<span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">stlab</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">async</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">an_executor</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[]</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">});</span>

<span class="c1">// The continuation on another executor.</span>
<span class="n">f</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">then</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">another_executor</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[](</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">cout</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>


<p>While <strong>executors</strong> are present in <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_65_1/doc/html/thread.html">Boost.Thread</a>, <strong>stlabs's</strong> <a href="http://stlab.cc/libraries/concurrency/channel/channel.html">channels</a> are unique to this <strong>future</strong> library. <strong>Channels</strong> are one of the Go language's favorite <a href="https://gobyexample.com/channels">toy</a>. It is a neat way to create communication between a <strong>sender</strong> and a <strong>receiver</strong> on different <strong>executors</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">auto</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">sender</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">receiver</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">channel</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">receive_executor</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// Create the link.</span>

<span class="n">receiver</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="p">[](</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">cout</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">};</span> <span class="c1">// Define what should happen at the reception.</span>

<span class="c1">// Establish the connections.</span>
<span class="n">receiver</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">set_ready</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="n">sender</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// Sent 42 through the channel.</span>
<span class="c1">// Receiver will print 42 when executing the task.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I really like some of the features in <strong>stlabs</strong>, hopefully this could be incorporated into the <strong>C++</strong> standard (the executors are down in the pipe of the standardisation process).</p>
<h3>[Talk] Introduction to proposed std::expected<T, E> - Niall Douglas - 💀💀💀 ★</h3>

<p>Are you the kind of person that would rather have errors on the return values rather than using <strong>exceptions</strong>. <a href="https://twitter.com/ned14?lang=en">Niall</a> has a solution for you: <a href="https://github.com/viboes/std-make/blob/master/doc/proposal/expected/p0323r3.pdf">std::expected&lt;T, E></a>. You can see <strong>std::expected&lt;T, E></strong> either as a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional">std::optional&lt;T></a> with a empty state containing an error for being empty, or as a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant">std::variant&lt;T, E></a> where you agree that the first alternative is the return value and the second alternative is the potential error. Example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">expected</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">string</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">make_unexpected</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;x &lt; 0&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>    
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">result</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">cout</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">result</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">error</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// Prints &quot; x &lt; 0&quot;.</span>
</pre></div>


<p><strong>std::expected</strong> starts to be cumbersome to use when combining or propogating returned results. To palliate this problem, <strong>std::expected</strong> exposes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)">Monad interface</a>, with the bind member function coming directly to your mind. If you are a Haskell user, <strong>std::expected</strong> should remind you of the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding_monads/Maybe">Maybe Monad</a>. Using <strong>bind</strong> is still verbose and hopefully we obtain a dedicated keyword <strong>try</strong> to ease our pain.</p>
<h2>[Talk] The most valuable values - Juan Pedro Bolívar Puente - 💀💀 ★★</h2>
<ul>
<li>Slides: <a href="">coming-soon</a></li>
<li>Video: <a href="">coming-soon</a></li>
</ul>
<p>During his presentation, <a href="https://sinusoid.es/do">Juan</a> actively promoted <a href="https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/value-vs-ref-semantics#val-vs-ref-semantics">value semantic over reference semantic</a> and did so with some analogies from our physical world (from our dear philosopher Platos) and code examples. The talk quickly moved onto immutability and functionnal programming applied to user interfaces. There is a trend in the web sphere to follow a software architectural pattern called <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/">flux</a> with a main implementation the <a href="https://redux.js.org/">redux</a> framework. Arguably, <strong>flux</strong> is a glorified good old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC (Model View Controller) architecture</a> with a strong emphasis on the immutability of the <strong>model</strong> and strict <strong>flow</strong> on the interactions between the components of <strong>MVC</strong>. <strong>Model</strong>, <strong>View</strong> and <strong>Controller</strong> also get respectively renamed to <strong>Store</strong>, <strong>View</strong> and <strong>Dispatcher</strong>. An action submitted to the <strong>Dispatcher</strong> will update the <strong>Store</strong> with a new <strong>Store</strong> in a determinstic way, which will imply a redraw of the <strong>View</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Juan</strong> succeeded to mimic <strong>redux</strong> in the <strong>C++</strong> world using his library <a href="https://sinusoid.es/immer/">immer</a>. To demonstrate the capabilities of his library, <strong>Juan</strong> recreated an emacs-like <a href="https://github.com/arximboldi/ewig">editor</a>. The beauty of having an immutable <strong>Store</strong> is truly expressed in the <strong>time-traveling machine</strong> that you can create from it: by saving all the states of the <strong>Store</strong>, you can easily come back to a previous state of your application (similar to undo / redo). You should absolutely watch the video to understand how easy it seems to implement this. On top of that you will have the chance to watch what might be the most audacious ending of a <strong>C++</strong> talk I have ever seen.</p>
<h2>[Talk] Reactive Equations - André Bergner - 💀💀💀 ★★★</h2>
<ul>
<li>Github project: <a href="https://github.com/andre-bergner/zignal/tree/master/reactive_equations">link</a></li>
<li>Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYNRoeWJuAw">link</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As a meta-programmer aficionado, this was the most "devilish" talk, and therefore highly thrilling, I attended during the event. It was not the first time I heard from <strong>André Bergner</strong>, he attended the cppcon in 2015 and I remembered that he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVLLdGlbCSw">presented</a> a nice way to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">currying</a> on your function. This time, <strong>André</strong> focused on reactive equations. If this sounds foreign to you, you might be more familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binding">data binding</a> in <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-javascript-expressions.html#javascript-in-property-bindings">Qt QML</a> using Javascript expression. <strong>André</strong>'s reactive equations are similar but with simpler expressions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// ***** Using a pseudo-language, let&#39;s define the equations *****</span>
<span class="nl">x</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">float</span>
<span class="nl">y</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">float</span>
<span class="nl">z</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">float</span>

<span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">42</span> <span class="c1">// When x is updated, y will be automatically updated.</span>
<span class="n">z</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="c1">// When y or x is updated, z will be automatically updated.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You may notice that I didn't write any <strong>C++</strong> code. By default <strong>C++</strong> would not permit to have expressions that update themselves by "magic" if one variable changes. You could write the update logic manually, but with a lot of long equations, this becomes very error prone. Instead <strong>André</strong> created a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL (Domain Specific Language)</a>, which is equivalent to create a language within <strong>C++</strong> itself. To define his DSL, <strong>André</strong> used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_templates">expression templates</a>. <strong>Expression templates</strong> are tricky creatures, which roughly consist in encapsulating <strong>C++</strong> expressions into a type at compile-time. This type will retain all the operators / functions (let's call them operations) that you applied in your expression. These operations can be queried at compile-time to generate other expression that you will execute at runtime. In <strong>André</strong>'s case, the encapsulated operations from his reactive equations would be used to automagically generate the update logic. To facilitate his task, <strong>André</strong> heavily relied on <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_65_1/doc/html/proto.html">Boost.Proto</a>. If you are versed in the art of meta-programming, this will certainely be entertaining to you!</p>

<p>This was a glorious hymn to our beloved free functions by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/klaus-iglberger-2133694/">Klaus Iglberger</a>. Programmers often resort to use <strong>member functions</strong> and inheritance to provide polyphormism in <strong>C++</strong>, often overlooking that <strong>free functions</strong> and <strong>overloading</strong> would be a smarter choice.</p>
<p>Let's take a situation where you would need to implement a <strong>serialise</strong> function for a bunch of unrelated types. Would rather use the implementation <strong>1</strong>?</p>

<p>As <strong>Kate</strong> explained, it is complicated! If you are looking for <strong>runtime polyphormism</strong>, then you will certainely use the solution <strong>1</strong>. If not, the solution <strong>2</strong> is actually preferable. It has a lot of advantages that <strong>Klaus</strong> explained for one full hour. My favorite one being that you can extend your polyphormism to types that you do not own. Let's say that you want to serialise <strong>std::vector</strong>, you can simply write an overload for it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">serialise</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">vector</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;&amp;</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="cm">/* return something... */</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In practice, nothing prevent you from mixing a both solutions to your needs. One counter-argument being that <strong>free functions</strong> have an ugly syntax: <code>v.serialise();</code> feels more natural than <code>serialize(v);</code>. That issue could have been solve with the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0251r0.pdf">unified call syntax</a> proposal by <strong>Bjarne Stroustrup</strong> and <strong>Herb Sutter</strong>. Sadly, it was rejected by the <strong>C++</strong> committee.</p>
<h2>[Talk] Reader-Write Lock versus Mutex - Understanding a Lost Bet - Jeffrey Mendelsohn - 💀💀💀 ★★</h2>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-mendelsohn-ph-d-8417454">Jeffrey Mendelson</a> from <strong>Bloomberg</strong> had a bet with a colleague on whether a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers%E2%80%93writer_lock">readers-writer lock</a> would be faster than a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)">mutex</a> to protect the access on a <strong>resource</strong> that could be written by a single writer, but could have multiple readers simultaneously. The <strong>readers-writer lock</strong> would follow exactly that behaviour (multiple readers, single writer). The <strong>mutex</strong> would keep the exclusivity to one writer or one reader only! <strong>Jeffrey</strong> lost the bet, but that did not hindered him from exploring the reasons behind his lost. It was challenging for me to grasp all the implications on this topic, but here is what I understood:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jeffrey</strong>'s <strong>reader-writer lock</strong> was made of <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic">atomic variables</a> to keep track of the amount of readers and writers. If the <strong>resource</strong> was currently written onto, the <strong>readers</strong> and other <strong>writers</strong> would wait onto a semaphor to be waken-up later on.</li>
<li>If the amount of time spent by the <strong>readers</strong> or the <strong>writers</strong> on the resource is fairly long, the <strong>readers-writer lock</strong> will actually perform better than the <strong>mutex</strong> as multiple <strong>reader</strong> can process simultanesouly.</li>
<li>On the other hand, if the <strong>writing</strong> and <strong>reading operations</strong> are very fast, the <strong>atomic operations</strong> on the counters will start to be costly comparatively. <strong>Atomics</strong> tend to have nonnegligible effects on the cache lines of your CPU(s). In this case, loosing the ability to have multiple <strong>readers</strong> is actually not as dramatic as you would think in comparison of stressing your cache.</li>
<li><strong>Jeffrey</strong> came up with an hybrid solution that combines both a <strong>readers-writer lock</strong> and a fallback to a <strong>mutex</strong> that outperformed the previous solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the video of this talk is uploaded, I must have a complete rewatch of it. It always amusing that our intuitions can be entirely wrong when it comes to concurrency and programming.  </p>

      <p>I had the chance to participate last week in a <strong>C++ meetup</strong>.
This <a href="https://www.meetup.com/swedencpp/">Stockholm meetup group</a> is fairly recent but has a lot of potential!
I am always enjoying my time during these sessions, surrounded by the smart and passionated people.
In the unlikely chance that you are living around <strong>Stockholm</strong>, or decided to visit the capital of Scandinavia (and start missing your keyboard), I would highly recommend you to join this group.</p>
<p>For the second edition of our conference <strong>C++ Stockholm 0x02</strong>, I volunteered for talk about a subject I already adressed in the blog: <a href="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/sfinae-introduction.html">SFINAE and compile-time introspection</a>.
Overall, it was a good exercise for a first talk but I definitely need more training :). 
I discovered that it is much harder than I expected to explain code in live.
Thanks to the meetup team, I have a video of this talk with a very nice editing job done on it. 
It is always a weird experience to watch yourself on a video and was not so keen to put it here in the first place. 
But since this video has already <em>leaked</em> among my friends (or foes in that case) and colleagues, I guess I might place it for the posterity!
So, here it is:</p>

      <h3>Trivia:</h3>
<p>One of our favorite motto in our C++ team at work is: you shall use <strong>dependency injections</strong> instead of <strong>singletons</strong>! It actually comes with our unit-testing strategy. If the various components of your architecture are too tightly coupled, it becomes a tremendous effort to deeply test small critical chunks of your code. <strong>Singletons</strong> are that kind of beast that revives itself without your permission and comes from hell to haunt your lovely unit-tests. Our main project being multi-threaded (hence highly bug-prone) and vital for the company, "<strong>singleton</strong>" became a forbidden word. Yet, our team recently started going down the dark path. Thanks to C++11 and its variadic templates, I carefully crafted a <strong>thread-safe multi-type map container</strong> that simplified our configuration reloading system and saved us from the dark side of the coder force. If you always wondered what are <strong>variadic templates</strong>, how <strong>C++11's tuples</strong> can be implemented, I am going to present these concepts in this post using my container as a cobaye.</p>
<p>Note: for the sake of your sanity and the fact that <em>errare humanum est</em>, this article might not be 100% accurate!</p>
<h3>Why would I use a thread-safe multi-type map?</h3>
<p>Let me explain our odyssey: we are working on a highly modular and multi-threaded application. One of its core feature is the ability to reload various configuration files or assets used by some components spread accross many threads and a giant hierarchy of objects. The reloading process is automic using Linux's <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html">inotify</a> monitoring filesystem events. One thread is dedicated to the reception of filesystem events and must react accordingly by parsing any changes and pushing them to other threads. At first, we used, to pass-by any newly parsed asset, some thread-safe <strong>queues</strong> or something analog to <a href="https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/2">go channels</a>. Since we did not want to use <strong>singletons</strong>, we had to pass references to our queues all along our object hierarchy. Sadly, our <strong>queue</strong> implementation is <strong>one to one</strong> and supports only <strong>one type</strong>, none of our config/asset types share the same <strong>base-type</strong>. For each asset type and each component using this asset, we had to create a new <strong>queue</strong> and pass-it all along our hierarchy. That is certainely not convenient! What we really wanted was a hybrid class between a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map">std::map</a> and a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple">std::tuple</a>.</p>
<p>We could have used a <strong>std::map</strong> with <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/doc/html/variant.html">Boost.Variant</a> to store our items, using a type like the following <strong>"std::map&lt; std::string, std::shared_ptr&lt; Boost.Variant &lt; ConfigType1, ConfigType2&gt;&gt;&gt;"</strong>. <strong>Boost.Variant</strong> permits to encapsulate a <strong>heterogeneous set of types</strong> without <strong>common base-type or base-class</strong>, which solves one of our point. Another solution would be to encapsulate manually all our configuration classes in the same familly of classes, that is pretty cumbersome. But anyway, <strong>std::map</strong> does not guaranty any safety if you are writing and reading at the same time on a map slot. Secondly, <strong>std::shared_ptr</strong> does guaranty a thread-safe destruction of the pointee object (i.e: the reference counter is thread-safe) but nothing for the <strong>std::shared_ptr</strong> object itself. It means that copying a <strong>std::shared_ptr</strong> that could potentially be modified from another thread, might lead to an undefined behaviour. Even if we were to encapsulate all these unsafe accesses with mutexes, we are still lacking a nice mechanism to get update notifications for our objects. We do not want to constantly poll the latest version and propagate it through our code. And finally, if that solution were elegant enough, why would I currently write this blog post?</p>
<p><strong>C++11</strong> brings another collection type called <strong>std::tuple</strong>. It permits to store a set of elements of <strong>heterogeneous types</strong>. Take a look at this short example:</p>

<p><strong>Tuples</strong> are that kind of <strong>C++11</strong> jewelry that should decide your old-fashioned boss to upgrade your team's compiler (and his ugly tie). Not only I could store a <strong>const char* </strong> and two <strong>ints</strong> without any compiling error, but I could also access them using compile-time mechanisms. In some way, you can see tuples as a compile-time map using indexes or types as keys to reach its elements. You cannot use an index out of bands, it will be catched at compile-time anyway! Sadly, using a type as a key to retrieve an element is only possible if the type is unique in the <strong>tuple</strong>. At my work, we do have few config objects sharing the same class. Anyway, tuples weren't fitting our needs regarding thread safety and update events. Let's see what we could create using tasty <strong>tuples</strong> as an inspiration.</p>
<p>Note that some <strong>tuples</strong> implementations were already available before <strong>C++11</strong>, notably in <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/libs/tuple/doc/tuple_users_guide.html">boost</a>. <strong>C++11</strong> variadic templates are just very handy, as you will see, to construct such a class.</p>

<p>First and foremost, its name <strong>repository</strong> might not be well-suited for its responsibility. If your native language is the same as shakespeare and come-up with a better term, please feel free to submit it. In our internal usage, <strong>config repository</strong> sounded great!</p>
<p>I start by describing the slots necessary for my application by creating a new type <strong>MyRepository</strong> using a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/type_alias">type alias</a>. As you can see, I use the type of the slots as a key for accessing elements. But in case of contention, I must use a second key: an "empty type" ; like <strong>Key1</strong> and <strong>Key2</strong> in this example.
If using types as keys seems odd for you, fear not! Here is the most rational explanation I can share with you: we are trying to benefit from our "know-it-all compiler". Your compiler is mainly manipulating types, one can change its flow using these types during the compilation process. Note that these structs are not even complete (no definition), it has <strong>no impact</strong> for the <strong>runtime memory</strong> or <strong>runtime execution</strong> and that's the amazing part of <strong>meta-programming</strong>. The dispatch of an expression such as <strong>"myRepository.get&lt; int, Key1&gt;()"</strong> is done during your build-time.</p>
<p>You may also notice that every slot is actually a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr">std::shared_ptr</a>. It enforces a clean ressource management: in a multithreaded application, one must be really careful of the lifetime of heap objects. <strong>std::shared_ptr</strong> in this case permits me to ensure that even if someone replaces a value in a slot, other components on other threads manipulating the old value won't end up with a <strong>dangling pointer/reference</strong> bomb in their hands. Another solution would be to use plain value objects, but not only it would require copying big objects in every other components but it would also remove polymorphism.</p>
<p>As for the updates signalisation, you first create a watcher object that establishes a contract between a desired slot to watch and your context. You can thereafter query in thread-safe way weither an update has been made and, if so, poll the latest changes. The watcher object is actually a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr">std::unique_ptr</a> for a special class, it cannot be moved nor copied without your permission and will automagically disable the signalisation contract between the slot and your context, once destroyed. We will dive deeper in this topic in the comming sections.</p>
<p>Within our application, the repository object is encapsulated into a RuntimeContext object. This RuntimeContext object is created explicitely within our main entry point and passed as a reference to a great part of our components. We therefore keep the possibility to test our code easily by setting this RuntimeContext with different implementations. Here is a simplified version of our usage:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// runtimecontext.hpp</span>

<h3>Time for a C++11 implementation:</h3>
<p>We can decompose the solution in 3 steps: at first we need to implement a map that accepts <strong>multiple types</strong>, we then need to work on the <strong>thread safety</strong> and finish by the <strong>watcher mechanism</strong>. Let's first fulfill the mission of this post: introducing you to <strong>variadic templates</strong> to solve the multiple-type problem.</p>
<h4>Variadic templates:</h4>
<p>You may not have heard of <strong>variadic templates</strong> in <strong>C++11</strong> but I bet that you already used <strong>variadic functions</strong> like <strong>printf</strong> in <strong>C</strong> (maybe in a previous unsafe life). As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_function">wikipedia</a> kindly explains "a variadic function is a function of indefinite which accepts a variable number of arguments". In other words, a <strong>variadic function</strong> has potentially an infinite number of <strong>parameters</strong>. Likewise, a <strong>variadic template</strong> has potentially an infinite number of <strong>parameters</strong>. Let's see how to use them!</p>
<h5>Usage for variadic function templates:</h5>
<p>Let's say that you wish to create a template that accept an infinite number of class as arguments. You will use the following notation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">class</span><span class="p">...</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You specify a group of template parameters using the ellipsis notation named <strong>T</strong>. Note that this <strong>ellipsis</strong> notation is consistent with <strong>C</strong>'s variadic function notation. This group of parameters, called a <strong>parameter-pack</strong>, can then be used in your function template or your class template by <strong>expanding</strong> them. One must use the <strong>ellipsis</strong> notation again (this time after T) to <strong>expand</strong> the parameter pack <strong>T</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">class</span><span class="p">...</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">...)</span>
<span class="c1">//              ^ pack T       ^expansion</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Your function content.</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now that we have expanded <strong>T</strong>, what can we do Sir? Well, first you give to your expanded parameter <strong>types</strong>, a fancy <strong>name</strong> like <strong>t</strong>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">class</span><span class="p">...</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">...</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">//                                ^ your fancy t.</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Your function content.</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If <strong>T = T1, T2</strong>, then <strong>T... t = T1 t1, T2 t2</strong> and <strong>t = t1, t2</strong>. Brilliant, but is that all? Sure no! You can then <strong>expand</strong> again <strong>t</strong> using an "suffix-ellipsis" again:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">class</span><span class="p">...</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">...</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">anotherFunction</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="p">...);</span>
    <span class="c1">//                ^ t is expanded here! </span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Finally, you can call this function <strong>f</strong> as you would with a normal function template:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">class</span><span class="p">...</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">...</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">anotherFunction</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="p">...);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;foo&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;bar&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// Note: the argument deduction avoids us to use f&lt;int, const char*, const char*&gt;</span>
<span class="c1">// f(1, &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;) calls a generated f(int t1, const char* t2, const char* t3)</span>
<span class="c1">// with T1 = int, T2 = const char* and T3 = const char*,</span>
<span class="c1">// that itself calls anotherFunction(t1, t2, t3) equivalent to call anotherFunction(1, &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Actually, the <strong>expansion mechanism</strong> is creating <strong>comma-separated</strong> replication of the <strong>pattern</strong> you apply the <strong>ellipsis</strong> onto. If you think I am tripping out with template-related wording, here is a much more concret example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">class</span><span class="p">...</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">...</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">anotherFunction</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="p">...);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">class</span><span class="p">...</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">...</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">static_cast</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">double</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="p">)...);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// Call f(int* t1, int* t2).</span>
    <span class="c1">// Do a subcall to g(static_cast&lt;double&gt;(*t1), static_cast&lt;double&gt;(*t2)).</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">EXIT_SUCCESS</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I could use the pattern <strong>'*'</strong> for <strong>f</strong> parameters and therefore take them as a pointer! In the same manner, I applied the pattern <strong>'static_cast&lt; double&gt;(*)</strong> to get the value of each arguments and cast them as doubles before forwarding them to <strong>g</strong>.</p>
<p>One last example before moving to <strong>variadic class templates</strong>. One can combine "normal" template parameters with parameter packs and initiate a compile recursion on function templates. Let's take a look at this printing function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;iostream&gt;</span><span class="cp"></span>

<span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">HEAD</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">HEAD</span> <span class="n">head</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p><strong>Variadic templates</strong> are very interesting and I wouldn't be able to cover all their features within this post. It roughly feels like functional programming using your compiler, and even some <strong>Haskellers</strong> might listen to you if you bring that topic during a dinner. For those interested, I would challenge them to write a type-safe version of <strong>printf</strong> using variadic templates with the help of this <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/parameter_pack">reference</a>. After that, you will run and scream of fear at the precense of <strong>C</strong>'s <strong>vargs</strong>.</p>
<h5>"Variadic" inheritance:</h5>
<p>Sometimes during my programming sessions, I have a very awkward sensation that my crazy code will never compile and, yet, I finally see "build finished" in my terminal. I am talking about that kind of Frankenstein constructions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">};</span>

<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">B</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">};</span>

<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="nl">C</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="p">...</span> <span class="c1">// Variadic inheritance</span>
<span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="n">C</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">A</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">B</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Yes, we can now create a class inheriting of an infinite number of bases. If you remember my explanation about pattern replications separated by commas, you can imaginge that <strong>struct C: public T...</strong> will be "transformed" in <strong>struct C: public A, public B</strong>, <strong>public T</strong> being the pattern. We start to be able to combine multiple types, each exposing a small amount of methods, to create a flexible concret type. That's one step closer to our multi-type map, and if you are interested in this concept, take a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin">mixins</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of inheriting directly from multiple types, couldn't we inherit from some types that encapsulate our types? Absolutely! A traditional map has some <strong>slots</strong> accessible using keys and these slots contain a value. If you give me base-class you are looking for, I can give you access to the value it contains:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;iostream&gt;</span><span class="cp"></span>

<p>This code is not generic at all! We know how to create a generic <strong>Slot</strong> using a simple template, and we acquired the magic "create varidiac inheritance" skill. If my <strong>Repository</strong> class inherit from <strong>Slot&lt; TypeA&gt;</strong> and you call a method template with <strong>TypeA</strong> as a template argument, I can call the <strong>doGet</strong> method of the <strong>Slot&lt; TypeA&gt;</strong> base-class and give you back the <strong>value</strong> of <strong>TypeA</strong> in that repository. Let's fix the previous ugly copy-paste code:</p>

<img alt="A nice UML diagram of my classes" src="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/images/repository_uml.png"></p>
<p>Our repository class is missing an <strong>emplace</strong> method, right? <strong>emplace</strong> is taking a variable number of arguments with different types and <strong>forward</strong> them to create an object within one of our slots.

<p>This message is very confusing, our class does not inherit from <strong>Slot&lt; double, DefaultSlotKey&gt;</strong>! And we are talking about a <strong>clang</strong> output, I wonder what <strong>gcc</strong> or <strong>MSVC</strong> could produce... If you do not want to be assinated from your moody colleague with a spoon, here is a nice solution using <strong>C++11</strong>'s <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/static_assert">static_asserts</a>. <strong>Static asserts</strong> give you the possibility to generate your own compiler error messages in the same fashion as normal asserts but at compile-time. Using a the trait like <strong>std::is_base_of</strong>, you can suggest the user of your repository to check twice his type. Let's put this <strong>static_assert</strong> at the beggining of all the methods of <strong>Repository</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">static_assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">is_base_of</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Slot</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Type</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Key</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Repository</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Slots</span><span class="p">...</span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;::</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">,</span> 
          <span class="s">&quot;Please ensure that this type or this key exists in this repository&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We are done for this part (finally...), time to think about multi-threading! If you want to know more about the magic behind <strong>std::is_base_of</strong>, I would suggest you to read my previous post on <a href="//jguegant.github.io/blogs/tech/sfinae-introduction.html">SFINAE</a>, it might give you few hints. Here is a <a href="https://gist.github.com/Jiwan/c1daf7a80ebeb166dc61">gist</a> of what we achieved so far. Did you notice the change on <strong>emplace</strong>? If you do not understand it, have a look at <a href="http://thbecker.net/articles/rvalue_references/section_07.html">this explanation on perfect forwarding</a>. Sadly, it would be a way too long topic for this post (trust me on that point!) and has a minor impact on our repository right now.</p>
<h4>Let's play safe:</h4>
<p>The repository we just succeeded to craft can now be used in a single-thread environment without further investigation. But the initial decision was to make this class manipulable from multiple-threads without any worries considering the safety of our operations. As explained in the beginning of this post, we will not use direct values as we currently do, but instead allocate our objects on the heap and use some <strong>shared pointers</strong> to strictly control their <strong>lifetime</strong>. No matter which version (recent or deprecated) of the object a thread is manipulating, it's lifetime will be extended until the last thread using it definitely release it. It also implies that the objects themselves are thread-safe. In the case of read-only objects like configs or assets, it shouldn't be too much a burden. In this <a href="https://gist.github.com/Jiwan/cb66d01c38128a351f42">gist</a>, you will find a repository version using <strong>std::shared_ptrs</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>std::shared_ptr</strong> is an amazing feature of <strong>C++11</strong> when dealing with multi-threading, but has its weakness. Within my code (in the previous gist link) a race condition can occur:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// What if I try to copy value_ at the return point...</span>
<span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">shared_ptr</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Type</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">doGet</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">const</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">value_</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// ... meanwhile another thread is changing value_ to value?</span>
<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">doSet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">shared_ptr</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Type</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">value_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As specified: "If multiple threads of execution access the <strong>same</strong> std::shared_ptr object without synchronization and any of those accesses uses a non-const member function of shared_ptr then a data race will occur". Note that we are talking about the <strong>same</strong> shared pointer. Multiple shared pointer <strong>copies</strong> pointing to the same object are fine, as long as these copies originated from the same shared pointer in first place. Copies are sharing the same <strong>control block</strong>, where the <strong>reference counters</strong> (one for shared_ptr and one for weak_ptr) are located, and the specification says "the control block of a shared_ptr is thread-safe: different std::shared_ptr objects can be accessed using mutable operations, such as operator= or reset, simultaneously by multiple threads, even when these instances are copies, and share the same control block internally.".</p>
<p>Depending on the age of your compiler and its standard library, I suggest two solutions:</p>
<h5>1) A global mutex:</h5>
<p>A straightforward solution relies on a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/mutex">std::mutex</a> that we lock during <strong>doGet</strong> and <strong>doSet</strong> execution:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">...</span>
    <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">shared_ptr</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Type</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">doGet</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// The lock is enabled until value_ has been copied!</span>
        <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">lock_guard</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">mutex</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">lock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mutex_</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">value_</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">doSet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">shared_ptr</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Type</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// The lock is enabled until value has been copied into value!</span>
        <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">lock_guard</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">mutex</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">lock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mutex_</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="n">value_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">private</span><span class="o">:</span>
    <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">mutex</span> <span class="n">mutex_</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This solution is ideal if you have a <strong>Linux</strong> distribution that only ships <strong>gcc 4.8.x</strong> like mine. While not particularly elegant, it doesn't have a great impact on performances compared to the next solution. </p>
<h5>2) Atomic access functions:</h5>
<p>Starting from <strong>gcc 4.9</strong>, one can use <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr/atomic">atomic access functions</a> to manipulate shared pointers. I dream of a day where a specialisation for <strong>std::atomic&lt; std::shared_ptr<T>&gt;</strong> exists, but from now, we will resort to use <strong>std::atomic_load</strong> and <strong>std::atomic_exchange</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">...</span>
    <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">shared_ptr</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Type</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">doGet</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">const</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">atomic_load</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">value_</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">doSet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">shared_ptr</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Type</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">atomic_exchange</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">value_</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">private</span><span class="o">:</span>
    <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">shared_ptr</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Type</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">value_</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">...</span>
</pre></div>


<p><strong>Atomics</strong> are elegants and can often bring a great increase of performances if using lock-free instructions internally. Sadly, in the case of <strong>shared_ptrs</strong>, <strong>atomic_is_lock_free</strong> will return you <strong>false</strong>. By digging in <strong>libstdc++</strong> and <strong>libc++</strong>, you will find some mutexes. <strong>gcc</strong> seems to use a fixed size "pool" of mutexes attributed to a shared_ptr according to a hash of its pointee address, when dealing with atomic operations. In other words, no rocket-science for atomic shared pointers until now.</p>
<h4>Our own watchers:</h4>
<p>"...I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men..." <strong>-- The Night's Watch oath</strong></p>
<p>We want to be able to seal a bond between one of the slot and a context. By context, I mean the lifetime of an object in a thread, a function or a method. If an update has been made on that slot, we must be signaled in that context and to retrieve the new update. The bond must be destroyed if the context does not exist anymore. It should reminds you the Night's Watch oath ... as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization">RAII idiom</a>: "holding a resource is tied to object lifetime: resource acquisition is done during object creation, by the constructor, while resource deallocation is done during object destruction, by the destructor. If objects are destroyed properly, resource leaks do not occur.". A strong ownership policy can be obtained with the help of a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr">std::unique_ptr</a> and the signalisation can be done using a <strong>boolean flag</strong>.</p>
<p>We will, therefore, encapsulate a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic">std::atomic_bool</a> into a class <strong>Watcher</strong> automagically registered to a slot once created, and unregistered once destructed. This <strong>Watcher</strong> class also takes as a reference the slot in order to query its value as you can see:</p>

<p>As for the automatic registration, we will add two private methods <strong>registerWatcher</strong> and <strong>unregisterWatcher</strong> to our <strong>Slot</strong> class that add or remove a watcher from an internal list. The list is always protected, when accessed, with a <strong>std::mutex</strong> and tracks all the current watchers that must be signaled when <strong>set</strong> is called on that slot. </p>

<p>You may have notice that we are passing a bare <strong>WatcherType</strong> pointers. The ownership is actually given to whoever is using that watcher encapsulated within a <strong>std::unique_ptr</strong>. <strong>C++11</strong>'s unique pointers are designed such as you can pass a <strong>custom deleter</strong>, or a <strong>delete callback</strong> so to speak. Hence, we can create a method that get a <strong>Watcher</strong> for a <strong>Slot</strong>, and register as the deleter of that <strong>Watcher</strong> a <strong>lambda function</strong> designed to call <strong>unregisterWatcher</strong>. Note that the slot MUST always lives longer than the unique pointer and its associated watcher (it should not be a problem in most cases). Let's finish that <strong>Slot</strong> class forever and ever:</p>

<p>Are we done? Hell no, but we will be really soon. All we need is to expose the possibility to acquire a watcher from the repository itself. In the same manner as <strong>set</strong> and <strong>get</strong>, we simply dispatch using the type and the key on one of our slot:</p>

<h3>Trivia:</h3>
<p>As a C++ enthusiast, I usually follow the annual C++ conference <a href="http://cppcon.org/">cppconf</a> or at least try to keep myself up-to-date with the major events that happen there. One way to catch up, if you can't afford a plane ticket or the ticket, is to follow the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg">youtube channel</a> dedicated to this conference. This year, I was impressed by <strong>Louis Dionne</strong> talk entitled "C++ Metaprogramming: A Paradigm Shift". One feature called <strong>is_valid</strong> that can be found in Louis's <a href="http://github.com/boostorg/hana">Boost.Hana</a> library particulary caught my attention. This genious <strong>is_valid</strong> function heavily rely on an even more "magic" C++ programming technique coined with the term <strong>SFINAE</strong> discovered at the end of the previous century. If this acronym doesn't speak to you, don't be scared, we are going to dive straight in the subject.</p>
<p>Note: for the sake of your sanity and the fact that <em>errare humanum est</em>, this article might not be 100% accurate!</p>
<h3>Introspection in C++?</h3>
<p>Before explaining what is <strong>SFINAE</strong>, let's explore one of its main usage: <strong>introspection</strong>. As you might be aware, C++ doesn't excel when it comes to examine the type or properties of an object at runtime. The best ability provided by default would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information">RTTI</a>. Not only <strong>RTTI</strong> isn't always available, but it also gives you barely more than the current type of the manipulated object. Dynamic languages or those having <strong>reflection</strong> on the other hand are really convenient in some situations like <strong>serialization</strong>.</p>
<p>For instance, in Python, using reflection, one can do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">A</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c1"># Simply overrides the &#39;object.__str__&#39; method.</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__str__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;I am a A&quot;</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">B</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c1"># A custom method for my custom objects that I want to serialize.</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">serialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;I am a B&quot;</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">C</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="c1"># Oups! &#39;serialize&#39; is not a method. </span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">serialize</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__str__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;I am a C&quot;</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">serialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c1"># Let&#39;s check if obj has an attribute called &#39;serialize&#39;.</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">hasattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;serialize&quot;</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="c1"># Let&#39;s check if this &#39;serialize&#39; attribute is a method.</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">hasattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">serialize</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__call__&quot;</span><span class="p">):</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">serialize</span><span class="p">()</span>

    <span class="c1"># Else we call the __str__ method.</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">B</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">C</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">serialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="c1"># output: I am a A.</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">serialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="c1"># output: I am a B.</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">serialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="c1"># output: I am a C.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As you can see, during serialization, it comes pretty handy to be able to check if an object has an attribute and to query the type of this attribute. In our case, it permits us to use the <strong>serialize</strong> method if available and fall back to the more generic method <strong>str</strong> otherwise. Powerful, isn't it? Well, we can do it <strong>in plain C++</strong>!</p>
<p>Here is the <strong>C++14</strong> solution mentionned in <strong>Boost.Hana</strong> documentation, using <strong>is_valid</strong>:</p>

<p>As you can see, it only requires a bit more of boilerplate than Python, but not as much as you would expect from a language as complexe as C++. How does it work? Well if you are too lazy to read the rest, here is the simplest answer I can give you: unlike dynamically typed languages, your compiler has access a lot of static type information once fired. It makes sense that we can constraint your compiler to do a bit of work on these types! The next question that comes to your mind is "How to?". Well, right below we are going to explore the various options we have to enslave our favorite compiler for fun and profit! And we will eventually recreate our own <strong>is_valid</strong>.</p>
<h3>The old-fashioned C++98-way:</h3>
<p>Whether your compiler is a dinosaur, your boss refuses to pay for the latest Visual Studio license or you simply love archeology, this chapter will interest you. It's also interesting for the people stuck between C++11 and C++14. The solution in C++98 relies on 3 key concepts: <strong>overload resolution</strong>, <strong>SFINAE</strong> and the static behavior of <strong>sizeof</strong>. </p>
<h4>Overload resolution:</h4>
<p>A simple function call like "<strong>f(obj);</strong>"" in <strong>C++</strong> activates a mechanism to figure out which <strong>f</strong> function shoud be called according to the argument <strong>obj</strong>. If a <strong>set</strong> of <strong>f</strong> functions could accept <strong>obj</strong> as an argument, the compiler must choose the most appropriate function, or in other words <strong>resolve</strong> the best <strong>overload</strong>! Here is a good cppreference page explaining the full process: <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/overload_resolution">Overload resolution</a>. The rule of thumb in this case is <em>the compiler picks the candidate function whose parameters match the arguments most closely is the one that is called</em>. Nothing is better than a good example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// int can&#39;t be convert into a string.</span>
<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">d</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// int can be implicitly convert into a double, so this version could be selected, but...</span>
<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// ... this version using the type int directly is even more close!</span>

<span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// Call f(int i);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In C++ you also have some sink-hole functions that accept everything. First, function templates accept any kind of parameter (let's say T). But the true black-hole of your compiler, the devil variable vacuum, the oblivion of the forgotten types are the <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variadic">variadic functions</a>. Yes, exactly like the horrible C <strong>printf</strong>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(...);</span> <span class="c1">// Variadic functions are so &quot;untyped&quot; that...</span>
<span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// ...this templated function got the precedence!</span>

<span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// Call the templated function version of f.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The fact that function templates are less generic than variadic functions is the first point you must remember!</p>
<p>Note: A <strong>templated function</strong> can actually be more precise than a <strong>normal function</strong>. However, in case of a draw, the <strong>normal function</strong> will have the precedence. </p>
<h4>SFINAE:</h4>
<p>I am already teasing you with the power for already few paragraphs and here finally comes the explanation of this not so complex acronym. <strong>SFINAE</strong> stands for <strong>S</strong>ubstitution <strong>F</strong>ailure <strong>I</strong>s <strong>N</strong>ot <strong>A</strong>n <strong>E</strong>rror. In rough terms, a <strong>substitution</strong> is the mechanism that tries to replace the template parameters with the provided types or values. In some cases, if the <strong>substitution</strong> leads to an invalid code, the compiler shouldn't throw a massive amount of errors but simply continue to try the other available <strong>overloads</strong>. The <strong>SFINAE</strong> concept simply guaranties such a "sane" behavior for a "sane" compiler. For instance:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cm">/*</span>
<span class="cm"> The compiler will try this overload since it&#39;s less generic than the variadic.</span>
<span class="cm"> T will be replace by int which gives us void f(const int&amp; t, int::iterator* b = nullptr);</span>
<span class="cm"> int doesn&#39;t have an iterator sub-type, but the compiler doesn&#39;t throw a bunch of errors.</span>
<span class="cm"> It simply tries the next overload. </span>
<span class="cm">*/</span>
<span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">typename</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">iterator</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">it</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">nullptr</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// The sink-hole.</span>
<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(...)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// Calls void f(...) { }</span>
</pre></div>


<p>All the expressions won't lead to a <strong>SFINAE</strong>. A broad rule would be to say that all the <strong>substitutions</strong> out of the function/methods <strong>body</strong> are "safes". For a better list, please take a look at this <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae">wiki page</a>. For instance, a wrong substitution within a function <strong>body</strong> will lead to a horrible C++ template error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// The compiler will be really unhappy when it will later discover the call to hahahaICrash. </span>
<span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">T</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">hahahaICrash</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(...)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="c1">// The sink-hole wasn&#39;t even considered.</span>

<span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<h4>The operator sizeof:</h4>
<p>The <strong>sizeof operator</strong> is really a nice tool! It permits us to returns the size in bytes of a type or an expression at compilation time. <strong>sizeof</strong> is really interesting as it accurately evaluates an expression as precisely as if it were compiled.
One can for instance do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">typedef</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">type_test</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="n">type_test</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="c1">// In the following lines f won&#39;t even be truly called but we can still access to the size of its return type.</span>
<span class="c1">// Thanks to the &quot;fake evaluation&quot; of the sizeof operator.</span>
<span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">arrayTest</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="k">sizeof</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">())];</span>
<span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">cout</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="k">sizeof</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">endl</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Output 42.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>But wait! If we can manipulate some compile-time integers, couldn't we do some compile-time comparison? The answer is: absolutely yes, my dear reader! Here we are:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">typedef</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">yes</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Size: 1 byte.</span>
<span class="k">typedef</span> <span class="n">yes</span> <span class="n">no</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">];</span> <span class="c1">// Size: 2 bytes.</span>

<span class="c1">// Two functions using our type with different size.</span>

<h4>Combining everything:</h4>
<p>Now we have all the tools to create a solution to check the existence of a method within a type at compile time. You might even have already figured it out most of it by yourself. So let's create it:</p>

<p>The <strong>reallyHas</strong> struct is kinda tricky but necessary to ensure that serialize is a method and not a simple member of the type. You can do a lot of test on a type using variants of this solution (test a member, a sub-type...) and I suggest you to google a bit more about <strong>SFINAE</strong> tricks. Note: if you truly want a pure compile-time constant and avoid some errors on old compilers, you can replace the last <strong>value</strong> evaluation by: "<strong>enum { value = sizeof(test<T>(0)) == sizeof(yes) };</strong>". </p>
<p>You might also wonder why it doesn't work with <strong>inheritence</strong>. <strong>Inheritence</strong> in C++ and <strong>dynamic polymorphism</strong> is a concept available at runtime, or in other words, a data that the compiler won't have and can't guess! However, compile time type inspection is much more efficient (0 impact at runtime) and almost as powerful as if it were at runtime.
For instance:</p>

<p>The trade-off for a full coverage would be the readability. As you will see, C++11 shines in that domain!</p>
<h4>Time to use our genius idea:</h4>
<p>Now you would think that it will be super easy to use our <strong>hasSerialize</strong> to create a <strong>serialize</strong> function! Okay let's try it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">serialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">)</span>

        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">serialize</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// error: no member named &#39;serialize&#39; in &#39;A&#39;.</span>
    <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">to_string</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">A</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">serialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It might be hard to accept, but the error raised by your compiler is absolutely normal! If you consider the code that you will obtain after substitution and compile-time evaluation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">serialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="c1">// Dead branching, but the compiler will still consider it!</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">serialize</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// error: no member named &#39;serialize&#39; in &#39;A&#39;.</span>
    <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">to_string</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Your compiler is really a good guy and won't drop any dead-branch, and <strong>obj</strong> must therefore have both a <strong>serialize method</strong> and a <strong>to_string overload</strong> in this case. The solution consists in spliting the serialize function into two different functions: one where we solely use <strong>obj.serialize()</strong> and one where we use <strong>to_string</strong> according to <strong>obj's type</strong>. We come back to an earlier problem that we already solved, how to split according to a type? <strong>SFINAE</strong>, for sure! At that point we could re-work our <strong>hasSerialize</strong> function into a <strong>serialize</strong> function and make it return a <strong>std::string</strong> instead of compile time <strong>boolean</strong>. But we won't do it that way! It's cleaner to separate the <strong>hasSerialize</strong> test from its usage <strong>serialize</strong>.</p>
<p>We need to find a clever <strong>SFINAE</strong> solution on the signature of "<strong>template &lt;class T> std::string serialize(const T&amp; obj)</strong>". I bring you the last piece of the puzzle called <strong>enable_if</strong>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">B</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">T</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">void</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="c1">// Default template version.</span>

<p>As you can see, we can trigger a substitution failure according to a compile time expression with <strong>enable_if</strong>. Now we can use this failure on the "<strong>template &lt;class T> std::string serialize(const T&amp; obj)</strong>" signature to dispatch to the right version. Finally, we have the true solution of our problem:</p>

<p>Two details worth being noted! Firstly we use <strong>enable_if</strong> on the return type, in order to keep the paramater deduction, otherwise we would have to specify the type explicitely "<strong>serialize&lt;A>(a)</strong>". Second, even the version using <strong>to_string</strong> must use the <strong>enable_if</strong>, otherwise <strong>serialize(b)</strong> would have two potential overloads available and raise an ambiguity.

<p>Note: it's also important to know that this code creates a <strong>SFINAE</strong> on an expression ("<strong>&amp;C::serialize</strong>"). Whilst this feature wasn't required by the <strong>C++98</strong> standard, it was already in use depending on your compiler. It trully became a safe choice in <strong>C++11</strong>.</p>
<h3>When C++11 came to our help:</h3>
<p>After the great century leap year in 2000, people were fairly optimistic about the coming years. Some even decided to design a new standard for the next generation of <strong>C++</strong> coders like me! Not only this standard would ease <strong>TMP</strong> headaches (<strong>T</strong>emplate <strong>M</strong>eta <strong>P</strong>rogramming side-effects), but it would be available in the first decade, hence its code-name <strong>C++0x</strong>. Well, the standard sadly came the next decade (2011 ==&gt; <strong>C++11</strong>), but it brought a lot of features interesting for the purpose of this article. Let's review them!</p>
<h4>decltype, declval, auto &amp; co:</h4>
<p>Do you remember that the <strong>sizeof operator</strong> does a "fake evaluation" of the expression that you pass to it, and return gives you the size of the type of the expression? Well <strong>C++11</strong> adds a new operator called <strong>decltype</strong>. <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype">decltype</a> gives you the type of the of the expression it will evaluate. As I am kind, I won't let you google an example and give it to you directly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">B</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">decltype</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">serialize</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;test&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Evaluate b.serialize(), which is typed as std::string.</span>
<span class="c1">// Equivalent to std::string test = &quot;test&quot;;</span>
</pre></div>


<p><a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/declval">declval</a> is an utility that gives you a "fake reference" to an object of a type that couldn't be easily construct. <strong>declval</strong> is really handy for our <strong>SFINAE</strong> constructions. <strong>cppreference</strong> example is really straightforward, so here is a copy:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Default</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">const</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;}</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">NonDefault</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">NonDefault</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">NonDefault</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">const</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;}</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">decltype</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Default</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="n">n1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// int n1</span>
<span class="c1">//  decltype(NonDefault().foo()) n2 = n1; // error: no default constructor</span>
    <span class="k">decltype</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">declval</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">NonDefault</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="n">n2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">n1</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// int n2</span>
    <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">cout</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="s">&quot;n2 = &quot;</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">n2</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="sc">&#39;\n&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <strong>auto specifier</strong> <em>specifies that the type of the variable that is being declared will be automatically deduced</em>. <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/auto">auto</a> is equivalent of <strong>var</strong> in C#. <strong>auto</strong> in <strong>C++11</strong> has also a less famous but nonetheless usage for function declaration. Here is a good example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// Famous usage, auto deduced that test is a boolean, hurray!</span>



<span class="c1">//                             vvv t wasn&#39;t declare at that point, it will be after as a parameter!</span>

<span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="k">decltype</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">serialize</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="p">{</span>   <span class="p">}</span> <span class="c1">// No compilation error.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As you can see, <strong>auto</strong> permits to use the trailing return type syntax and use <strong>decltype</strong> coupled with an expression involving one of the function argument. Does it means that we can use it to test the existence of <strong>serialize</strong> with a SFINAE? Yes Dr. Watson! <strong>decltype</strong> will shine really soon, you will have to wait for the <strong>C++14</strong> for this tricky <strong>auto</strong> usage (but since it's a C++11 feature, it ends up here).</p>
<h4>constexpr:</h4>
<p>C++11 also came with a new way to do compile-time computations! The new keyword <strong>constexpr</strong> is a hint for your compiler, meaning that this expression is constant and could be evaluate directly at compile time. In C++11, <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constexpr">constexpr</a> has a lot of rules and only a small subset of VIEs (Very Important Expression) expressions can be used (no loops...)! We still have enough for creating a compile-time factorial function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">factorial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">?</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">factorial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">factorial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// Call to a constexpr function.</span>
<span class="c1">// Will be replace by a good compiler by:</span>
<span class="c1">// int i = 120;</span>
</pre></div>


<p><strong>constexpr</strong> increased the usage of <strong>std::true_type</strong> &amp; <strong>std::false_type</strong> from the STL. As their name suggest, these types encapsulate a constexpr boolean "true" and a constrexpr boolean "false". Their most important property is that a class or a struct can inherit from them. For instance:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="nl">testStruct</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">true_type</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">};</span> <span class="c1">// Inherit from the true type.</span>

<span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">testVar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">testStruct</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// Generate a compile-time testStruct.</span>
<span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">testStruct</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Equivalent to: test = true;</span>
<span class="n">test</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">testVar</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// true_type has a constexpr converter operator, equivalent to: test = true;</span>
</pre></div>


<h4>Blending time:</h4>
<h5>First solution:</h5>
<p>In cooking, a good recipe requires to mix all the best ingredients in the right proportions. If you don't want to have a spaghetti code dating from 1998 for dinner, let's revisit our C++98 <strong>hasSerialize</strong> and <strong>serialize</strong> functions with "fresh" ingredients from 2011. Let's start by removing the rotting <strong>reallyHas</strong> trick with a tasty <strong>decltype</strong> and bake a bit of <strong>constexpr</strong> instead of <strong>sizeof</strong>. After 15min in the oven (or fighting with a new headache), you will obtain:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">hasSerialize</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// We test if the type has serialize using decltype and declval.</span>
    <span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="n">C</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="k">decltype</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">declval</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">C</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">serialize</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="kt">bool</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="n">test</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="cm">/* unused */</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// We can return values, thanks to constexpr instead of playing with sizeof.</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="n">C</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">test</span><span class="p">(...)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">false</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="c1">// int is used to give the precedence!</span>
    <span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">test</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">());</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You might be a bit puzzled by my usage of <strong>decltype</strong>. The C++ comma operator "<strong>,</strong>" can create a chain of multiple expressions. In <strong>decltype</strong>, all the expressions will be evaluated, but only the last expression will be considered for the type. The <strong>serialize</strong> doesn't need any changes, minus the fact that the <strong>enable_if</strong> function is now provided in the <strong>STL</strong>. For your tests, here is a <a href="https://gist.github.com/Jiwan/21f65ddbd91e7ce93384">gist</a>.</p>
<h5>Second solution:</h5>
<p>Another C++11 solution described in <strong>Boost.Hanna</strong> documentation and using <strong>std::true_type</strong> and <strong>std::false_type</strong>, would be this one:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// Primary template, inherit from std::false_type.</span>
<span class="c1">// ::value will return false. </span>
<span class="c1">// Note: the second unused template parameter is set to default as std::string!!!</span>
<span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">typename</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">string</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="nl">hasSerialize</span>
        <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">false_type</span>
<span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="c1">// Partial template specialisation, inherit from std::true_type.</span>
<span class="c1">// ::value will return true. </span>
<span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">hasSerialize</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">decltype</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">declval</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">serialize</span><span class="p">())</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
        <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">true_type</span>
<span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This solution is, in my own opinion, more sneaky! It relies on a not-so-famous-property of default template parameters. But if your soul is already (stack-)corrupted, you may be aware that the <strong>default parameters</strong> are propagated in the <strong>specialisations</strong>. So when we use <strong>hasSerialize&lt;OurType>::value</strong>, the default parameter comes into play and we are actually looking for <strong>hasSerialize&lt;OurType, std::string>::value</strong> both on the <strong>primary template</strong> and the <strong>specialisation</strong>. In the meantime, the <strong>substitution</strong> and the evaluation of <strong>decltype</strong> are processed and our <strong>specialisation</strong> has the signature <strong>hasSerialize&lt;OurType, std::string></strong> if <strong>OurType</strong> has a <strong>serialize</strong> method that returns a <strong>std::string</strong>, otherwise the substitution fails. The <strong>specialisation</strong> has therefore the precedence in the good cases. One will be able to use the <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/void_t">std::void_t</a> C++17 helper in these cases. Anyway, here is a <a href="https://gist.github.com/Jiwan/160a64a5d1d25e4bdf6b">gist</a> you can play with!</p>
<p>I told you that this second solution hides a lot of complexity, and we still have a lot of C++11 features unexploited like <strong>nullptr</strong>, <strong>lambda</strong>, <strong>r-values</strong>. No worries, we are going to use some of them in <strong>C++14</strong>!</p>
<h3>The supremacy of C++14:</h3>
<p>According to the Gregorian calendar in the upper-right corner of my XFCE environment, we are in 2015! I can turn on the <strong>C++14</strong> compilation flag on my favorite compiler safely, isn't it? Well, I can with <strong>clang</strong> (is <strong>MSVC</strong> using a maya calendar?).
Once again, let's explore the new features, and use them to build something wonderful! We will even recreate an <strong>is_valid</strong>, like I promised at the beggining of this article.</p>
<h4>auto &amp; lambdas:</h4>
<h6>Return type inference:</h6>
<p>Some cool features in <strong>C++14</strong> come from the relaxed usage of the <strong>auto</strong> keyword (the one used for type inference).</p>
<p>Now, <strong>auto</strong> can be used on the return type of a function or a method. For instance:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">auto</span> <span class="nf">myFunction</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1">// Automagically figures out that myFunction returns ints.</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It works as long as the type is easily "guessable" by the compiler. We are coding in C++ after all, not OCaml! </p>
<h6>A feature for functional lovers:</h6>
<p><strong>C++11</strong> introduced <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda">lambdas</a>. A lambda has the following syntax: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[capture-list](params) -&gt; non-mandatory-return-type { ...body... }
</pre></div>


<p>A useful example in our case would be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">l1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[](</span><span class="n">B</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">serialize</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="p">};</span> <span class="c1">// Return type figured-out by the return statement.</span>

</pre></div>


<p><strong>C++14</strong> brings a small change to the <strong>lambdas</strong> but with a big impact! <strong>Lambdas</strong> accept <strong>auto parameters</strong>: the parameter type is deduced according the argument. <strong>Lambdas</strong> are implemented as an object having an newly created <strong>unnamed type</strong>, also called <strong>closure type</strong>. If a <strong>lambda</strong> has some <strong>auto parameters</strong>, its "Functor operator" <strong>operator()</strong> will be simply templated. Let's take a look:</p>

<p>More than the <strong>lambda</strong> itself, we are interested by the generated <strong>unnamed type</strong>: its lambda <strong>operator()</strong> can be used as a SFINAE! And as you can see, writing a <strong>lambda</strong> is less cumbersome than writing the equivalent type. It should remind you the beggining of my initial solution:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// Check if a type has a serialize method.</span>

</pre></div>


<p>And the good new is that we have everything to recreate <strong>is_valid</strong>, right now!</p>
<h4>The making-of a valid <strong>is_valid</strong>:</h4>
<p>Now that we have a really stylish manner to generate a <strong>unnamed types</strong> with potential <strong>SFINAE</strong> properties using <strong>lambdas</strong>, we need to figure out how to use them! As you can see, <strong>hana::is_valid</strong> is a function that takes our lambda as a parameter and return a type. We will call the type returned by <strong>is_valid</strong> the <strong>container</strong>. The <strong>container</strong> will be in charge to keep the lambda's <strong>unnamed type</strong> for a later usage. Let's start by writing the <strong>is_valid</strong> function and its the <strong>containter</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="n">UnnamedType</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">container</span>

<span class="c1">// Now &#39;test&#39; remembers the type of the lambda and the signature of its operator()!</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The next step consists at extending <strong>container</strong> with the operator <strong>operator()</strong> such as we can call it with an argument. This argument type will be tested against the <strong>UnnamedType</strong>! In order to do a test on the argument type, we can use once again a SFINAE on a reacreated 'UnnamedType' object! It gives us this solution:</p>

<p>If you are a bit lost at that point, I suggest you take your time and re-read all the previous example. You have all the weapons you need, now fight <strong>C++</strong>!</p>
<p>Our <strong>hasSerialize</strong> now takes an argument, we therefore need some changes for our serialize function. We can simply post-pone the return type using <strong>auto</strong> and use the argument in a <strong>decltype</strong> as we learn. Which gives us:</p>

<p><strong>FINALLY!!!</strong> We do have a working <strong>is_valid</strong> and we could use it for serialization! If I were as vicious as my SFINAE tricks, I would let you copy each code pieces to recreate a fully working solution. But today, Halloween's spirit is with me and here is <a href="https://gist.github.com/Jiwan/7a586c739a30dd90d259">gist</a>. Hey, hey! Don't close this article so fast! If you are true a warrior, you can read the last part!</p>
<h4>For the fun:</h4>
<p>There are few things I didn't tell you, on purpose. This article would otherwise be twice longer, I fear. I highly suggest you to google a bit more about what I am going to speak about.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Firstly, if you wish to have a solution that works with the <strong>Boost.Hana</strong> static <strong>if_</strong>, you need to change the return type of our <strong>testValidity</strong> methods by Hana's equivalents, like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="n">Param</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">test_validity</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="cm">/* unused */</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>The static <strong>if_</strong> implementation is really interesting, but at least as hard as our <strong>is_valid</strong> problem solved in this article. I might dedicate another article about it, one day!</p>

<p>Did you noticed that we only check one argument at a time? Couldn't we do something like:</p>

<p>This code is working even if my types are incomplete, for instance a forward declaration, or a normal declaration but with a missing definition. What can I do? Well, you can insert a check on the size of your type either in the <strong>SFINAE</strong> construction or before calling it: "<strong>static_assert( sizeof( T ), "type is incomplete." );</strong>".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, why are using the notation "<strong>&amp;&amp;</strong>" for the <strong>lambdas</strong> parameters? Well, these are called <strong>forwarding references</strong>. It's a really complex topic, and if you are interested, here is good <a href="http://thbecker.net/articles/rvalue_references/section_01.html">article</a> about it. You need to use "<strong>auto&amp;&amp;</strong>" due to the way <strong>declval</strong> is working in our <strong>is_valid</strong> implementation!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Notes:</h4>
<p>This is my first serious article about <strong>C++</strong> on the web and I hope you enjoyed it! I would be glad if you have any suggestions or questions and that you wish to share with me in the commentaries.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Naav">Naav</a> and <a href="https://github.com/superboum">Superboum</a> for rereading this article and theirs suggestions. Few suggestions were also provided by the reddit community or in the commentaries of this post, thanks a lot guys!</p>

      <p>Whilst I never had an urge to daily browse the various social networks, I have always liked to read technical articles and to follow few blogs. I wanted, since few years, to write my thoughts somewhere in order to clarify them and be able to easily fetch them later on. I procrastinated the idea of running a tech blog for few years, my aversion for the over-engineered web technologies and a lack of motivation restrained me. However, I have more spare time these days and I stumbled upon a simple and elegant Python static blog generator called <a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. With <strong>Pelican</strong> I don't have to pull a thousand of npm packages for a sanatizing function neither to use the latest language for hipsters with an eccentric syntax. Static pages also greatly simplify the maintenance and decrease the security burdens of dynamic websites.</p>
<p>If this blog is mostly for my own purpose, I also hope that I could get an external opinion on my posts, my methods or even my skills in the beautiful English language.</p>
